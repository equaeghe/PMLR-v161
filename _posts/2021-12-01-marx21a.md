title: A weaker faithfulness assumption based on triple interactions
abstract: One of the core assumptions in causal discovery is the faithfulness assumptionâ€”i.e.
  assuming that independencies found in the data are due to separations in the true
  causal graph. This assumption can, however, be violated in many ways, including
  xor connections, deterministic functions or cancelling paths. In this work, we propose
  a weaker assumption that we call 2-adjacency faithfulness. In contrast to adjacency
  faithfulness, which assumes that there is no conditional independence between each
  pair of variables that are connected in the causal graph, we only require no conditional
  independence between a node and a subset of its Markov blanket that can contain
  up to two nodes. Equivalently, we adapt orientation faithfulness to this setting.
  We further propose a sound orientation rule for causal discovery that applies under
  weaker assumptions. As a proof of concept, we derive a modified Grow and Shrink
  algorithm that recovers the Markov blanket of a target node and prove its correctness
  under strictly weaker assumptions than the standard faithfulness assumption.
