title: When is particle filtering efficient for planning in partially observed linear
  dynamical systems?
abstract: Particle filtering is a popular method for inferring latent states in stochastic
  dynamical systems, whose theoretical properties have been well studied in machine
  learning and statistics communities. In many control problems, e.g., partially observed
  linear dynamical systems (POLDS), oftentimes the inferred latent state is further
  used for planning at each step. This paper initiates a rigorous study on the efficiency
  of particle filtering for sequential planning, and gives the first particle complexity
  bounds. Though errors in past actions may affect the future, we are able to bound
  the number of particles needed so that the long-run reward of the policy based on
  particle filtering is close to that based on exact inference. In particular, we
  show that, in stable systems, polynomially many particles suffice. Key in our proof
  is a coupling of the ideal sequence based on the exact planning and the sequence
  generated by approximate planning based on particle filtering. We believe this technique
  can be useful in other sequential decision-making problems.
