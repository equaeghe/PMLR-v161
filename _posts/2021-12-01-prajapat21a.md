title: Competitive policy optimization
abstract: 'A core challenge in policy optimization in competitive Markov decision
  processes is the design of efficient optimization methods with desirable convergence
  and stability properties. We propose competitive policy optimization (CoPO), a novel
  policy gradient approach that exploits the game-theoretic nature of competitive
  games to derive policy updates. Motivated by the competitive gradient optimization
  method, we derive a bilinear approximation of the game objective. In contrast, off-the-shelf
  policy gradient methods utilize only linear approximations, and hence do not capture
  playersâ€™ interactions. We instantiate CoPO in two ways: (i) competitive policy gradient,
  and (ii) trust-region competitive policy optimization. We theoretically study these
  methods, and empirically investigate their behavior on a set of comprehensive, yet
  challenging, competitive games. We observe that they provide stable optimization,
  convergence to sophisticated strategies, and higher scores when played against baseline
  policy gradient methods.'
