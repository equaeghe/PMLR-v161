title: Random probabilistic circuits
abstract: Density estimation could be viewed as a core component in machine learning,
  since a good estimator could be used to solve many tasks such as classification,
  regression, and imputing missing values. The main challenge of density estimation
  is balancing the model expressiveness and its learning and inference complexity.
  Probabilistic circuits (PCs) model a probability distribution as a computational
  graph. By imposing specific structural properties on such models many inference
  tasks become tractable. However, learning PCs usually relies on greedy and time
  consuming procedures. In this paper we propose a new unified approach to efficiently
  learn PCs having several structural properties. We introduce extremely randomized
  PCs (XPCs), PCs with a random structure. We show their advantage on standard density
  estimation benchmarks when compared to other density estimators.
