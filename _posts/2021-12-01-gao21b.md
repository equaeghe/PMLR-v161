title: Learning and certification under instance-targeted poisoning
abstract: In this paper, we study PAC learnability and certification under instance-targeted
  poisoning attacks, where the adversary may change a fraction of the training set
  with the goal of fooling the learner at a specific target instance. Our first contribution
  is to formalize the problem in various settings, and explicitly discussing subtle
  aspects such as learner’s randomness and whether (or not) adversary’s attack can
  depend on it. We show that when the budget of the adversary scales sublinearly with
  the sample complexity, PAC learnability and certification are achievable. In contrast,
  when the adversary’s budget grows linearly with the sample complexity, the adversary
  can potentially drive up the expected 0-1 loss to one. We also study distribution-specific
  PAC learning in the same attack model and show that proper learning with certification
  is possible for learning half spaces under natural distributions. Finally, we empirically
  study the robustness of K nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron,
  and convolutional neural network on real data sets against targeted-poisoning attacks.
  Our experimental results show that many models, especially state-of-the-art neural
  networks, are indeed vulnerable to these strong attacks. Interestingly, we observe
  that methods with high standard accuracy might be more vulnerable to instance-targeted
  poisoning attacks.
