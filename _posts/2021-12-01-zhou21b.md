title: Unsupervised program synthesis for images by sampling without replacement
abstract: Program synthesis has emerged as a successful approach to the image parsing
  task. Most prior works rely on a two-step scheme involving supervised pretraining
  of a Seq2Seq model with synthetic programs followed by reinforcement learning (RL)
  for fine-tuning with real reference images. Fully unsupervised approaches promise
  to train the model directly on the target images without requiring curated pretraining
  datasets. However, they struggle with the inherent sparsity of meaningful programs
  in the search space. In this paper, we present the first unsupervised algorithm
  capable of parsing constructive solid geometry (CSG) images into context-free grammar
  (CFG) without pretraining. To tackle the <em>non-Markovian</em> sparse reward problem,
  we combine three key ingredients—(i) a grammar-encoded tree LSTM ensuring program
  validity (ii) entropy regularization and (iii) sampling without replacement from
  the CFG syntax tree. Empirically, our algorithm recovers meaningful programs in
  large search spaces (up to $3.8 \times 10^{28}$). Further, even though our approach
  is fully unsupervised, it generalizes better than supervised methods on the synthetic
  2D CSG dataset. On the 2D computer aided design (CAD) dataset, our approach significantly
  outperforms the supervised pretrained model and is competitive to the refined model.
