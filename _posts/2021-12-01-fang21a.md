title: Efficient greedy coordinate descent via variable partitioning
abstract: Greedy coordinate descent (GCD) is an efficient optimization algorithm for
  a wide range of machine learning and data mining applications. GCD could be significantly
  faster than randomized coordinate descent (RCD) if they have similar per iteration
  cost. Nevertheless, in some cases, the greedy rule used in GCD cannot be efficiently
  implemented, leading to huge per iteration cost and making GCD slower than RCD.
  To alleviate the cost per iteration, the existing solutions rely on maximum inner
  product search (MIPS) as an approximate greedy rule. But it has been empirically
  shown that GCD with approximate greedy rule could suffer from slow convergence even
  with the state-of-the-art MIPS algorithms. We propose a hybrid coordinate descent
  algorithm with a simple variable partition strategy to tackle the cases when greedy
  rule cannot be implemented efficiently. The convergence rate and theoretical properties
  of the new algorithm are presented. The proposed method is shown to be especially
  useful when the data matrix has a group structure. Numerical experiments with both
  synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our new algorithm is competitive
  against RCD, GCD, approximate GCD with MIPS and their accelerated variants.
