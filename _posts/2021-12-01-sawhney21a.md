title: Modeling financial uncertainty with multivariate temporal entropy-based curriculums
abstract: 'In the financial realm, profit generation greatly relies on the complicated
  task of stock prediction. Lately, neural methods have shown success in exploiting
  stock affecting signals from textual data across news and tweets to forecast stock
  performance. However, the dynamic, stochastic, and variably influential nature of
  text and prices makes it difficult to train neural stock trading models, limiting
  predictive performance and profits. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel
  multi-modal curriculum learning approach: FinCLASS, which evaluates stock affecting
  signals via entropy-based heuristics and measures their linguistic and price-based
  complexities in a time-aware, hierarchical fashion. We show that training financial
  models can benefit by exposing neural networks to easier examples of stock affecting
  signals early during the training phase, before introducing samples having more
  complex linguistic and price-based temporal variations. Through experiments on benchmark
  English tweets and Chinese financial news spanning two major indexes and four global
  markets, we show how FinCLASS outperforms state-of-the-art across financial tasks
  of stock movement prediction, volatility regression, and profit generation. Through
  ablative and qualitative experiments, we set the case for FinCLASS as a generalizable
  framework for developing natural language-centric neural models for financial tasks.'
