title: Conditionally independent data generation
abstract: Conditional independence (CI) is a fundamental concept with wide applications
  in machine learning and causal inference. Although the problems of testing CI and
  estimating divergences have been extensively studied, the complementary problem
  of generating data that satisfies CI has received much less attention. A special
  case of the generation problem is to produce conditionally independent predictions.
  Given samples from an input data distribution, we formulate the problem of generating
  samples from a distribution that is close to the input distribution and satisfies
  CI. We establish a characterization of CI in terms of a general divergence identity.
  Based on one version of this identity, an architecture is proposed that leverages
  the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enforce CI in an end-to-end
  differentiable manner. As one illustration of the problem formulation and architecture,
  we consider applications to notions of fairness that can be written as CIs, specifically
  equalized odds and conditional statistical parity. We demonstrate conditionally
  independent prediction that trades off adherence to fairness criteria against classification
  accuracy.
