title: Classification with abstention but without disparities
abstract: Classification with abstention has gained a lot of attention in recent years
  as it allows to incorporate human decision-makers in the process. Yet, abstention
  can potentially amplify disparities and lead to discriminatory predictions. The
  goal of this work is to build a general purpose classification algorithm, which
  is able to abstain from prediction, while avoiding disparate impact. We formalize
  this problem as risk minimization under fairness and abstention constraints for
  which we derive the form of the optimal classifier. Building on this result, we
  propose a post-processing classification algorithm, which is able to modify any
  off-the-shelf score-based classifier using only unlabeled sample. We establish finite
  sample risk, fairness, and abstention guarantees for the proposed algorithm. In
  particular, it is shown that fairness and abstention constraints can be achieved
  independently from the initial classifier as long as sufficiently many unlabeled
  data is available. The risk guarantee is established in terms of the quality of
  the initial classifier. Our post-processing scheme reduces to a sparse linear program
  allowing for an efficient implementation, which we provide. Finally, we validate
  our method empirically showing that moderate abstention rates allow to bypass the
  risk-fairness trade-off.
