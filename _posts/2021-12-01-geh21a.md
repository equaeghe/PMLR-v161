title: Learning probabilistic sentential decision diagrams under logic constraints
  by sampling and averaging
abstract: Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) are effective tools for
  combining uncertain knowledge in the form of (learned) probabilities and certain
  knowledge in the form of logical constraints. Despite some promising recent advances
  in the topic, very little attention has been given to the problem of effectively
  learning PSDDs from data and logical constraints in large domains. In this paper,
  we show that a simple strategy of sampling and averaging PSDDs leads to state-of-the-art
  performance in many tasks. We overcome some of the issues with previous methods
  by employing a top-down generation of circuits from a logic formula represented
  as a BDD. We discuss how to locally grow the circuit while achieving a good trade-off
  between complexity and goodness-of-fit of the resulting model. Generalization error
  is further decreased by aggregating sampled circuits through an ensemble of models.
  Experiments with various domains show that the approach efficiently learns good
  models even in very low data regimes, while remaining competitive for large sample
  sizes.
