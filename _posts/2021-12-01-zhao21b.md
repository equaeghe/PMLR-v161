title: Diagnostics for conditional density models and Bayesian inference algorithms
abstract: There has been growing interest in the AI community for precise uncertainty
  quantification. Conditional density models f(y|x), where x represents potentially
  high-dimensional features, are an integral part of uncertainty quantification in
  prediction and Bayesian inference. However, it is challenging to assess conditional
  density estimates and gain insight into modes of failure. While existing diagnostic
  tools can determine whether an approximated conditional density is compatible overall
  with a data sample, they lack a principled framework for identifying, locating,
  and interpreting the nature of statistically significant discrepancies over the
  entire feature space. In this paper, we present rigorous and easy-to-interpret diagnostics
  such as (i) the “Local Coverage Test” (LCT), which distinguishes an arbitrarily
  misspecified model from the true conditional density of the sample, and (ii) “Amortized
  Local P-P plots” (ALP) which can quickly provide interpretable graphical summaries
  of distributional differences at any location x in the feature space. Our validation
  procedures scale to high dimensions and can potentially adapt to any type of data
  at hand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LCT and ALP through a simulated experiment
  and applications to prediction and parameter inference for image data.
