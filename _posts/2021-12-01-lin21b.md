title: 'Escaping from zero gradient: Revisiting action-constrained reinforcement learning
  via Frank-Wolfe policy optimization'
abstract: Action-constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is a widely-used approach
  in various real-world applications, such as scheduling in networked systems with
  resource constraints and control of a robot with kinematic constraints. While the
  existing projection-based approaches ensure zero constraint violation, they could
  suffer from the zero-gradient problem due to the tight coupling of the policy gradient
  and the projection, which results in sample-inefficient training and slow convergence.
  To tackle this issue, we propose a learning algorithm that decouples the action
  constraints from the policy parameter update by leveraging state-wise Frank-Wolfe
  and a regression-based policy update scheme. Moreover, we show that the proposed
  algorithm enjoys convergence and policy improvement properties in the tabular case
  as well as generalizes the popular DDPG algorithm for action-constrained RL in the
  general case. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
  outperforms the benchmark methods on a variety of control tasks.
