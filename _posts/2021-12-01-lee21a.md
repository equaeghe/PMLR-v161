title: A Nonmyopic Approach to Cost-Constrained Bayesian Optimization
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate
  black-box functions. BO budgets are typically given in iterations, which implicitly
  assumes each evaluation has the same cost. In fact, in many BO applications, evaluation
  costs vary significantly in different regions of the search space. In hyperparameter
  optimization, the time spent on neural network training increases with layer size;
  in clinical trials, the monetary cost of drug compounds vary; and in optimal control,
  control actions have differing complexities. Cost-constrained BO measures convergence
  with alternative cost metrics such as time, money, or energy, for which the sample
  efficiency of standard BO methods is ill-suited. For cost-constrained BO, cost efficiency
  is far more important than sample efficiency. In this paper, we formulate cost-constrained
  BO as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and develop an efficient rollout
  approximation to the optimal CMDP policy that takes both the cost and future iterations
  into account. We validate our method on a collection of hyperparameter optimization
  problems as well as a sensor set selection application.
