title: An optimization and generalization analysis for max-pooling networks
abstract: Max-Pooling operations are a core component of deep learning architectures.
  In particular, they are part of most convolutional architectures used in machine
  vision, since pooling is a natural approach to pattern detection problems. However,
  these architectures are not well understood from a theoretical perspective. For
  example, we do not understand when they can be globally optimized, and what is the
  effect of over-parameterization on generalization. Here we perform a theoretical
  analysis of a convolutional max-pooling architecture, proving that it can be globally
  optimized, and can generalize well even for highly over-parameterized models. Our
  analysis focuses on a data generating distribution inspired by pattern detection
  problem, where a “discriminative” pattern needs to be detected among “spurious”
  patterns. We empirically validate that CNNs significantly outperform fully connected
  networks in our setting, as predicted by our theoretical results.
