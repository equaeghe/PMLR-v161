title: Condition number bounds for causal inference
abstract: An important achievement in the field of causal inference was a complete
  characterization of when a causal effect, in a system modeled by a causal graph,
  can be determined uniquely from purely observational data. The identification algorithms
  resulting from this work produce exact <em>symbolic</em> expressions for causal
  effects, in terms of the observational probabilities. More recent work has looked
  at the <em>numerical</em> properties of these expressions, in particular using the
  classical notion of the <em>condition number</em>. In its classical interpretation,
  the condition number quantifies the sensitivity of the output values of the expressions
  to small numerical perturbations in the input observational probabilities. In the
  context of causal identification, the condition number has also been shown to be
  related to the effect of certain kinds of uncertainties in the <em>structure</em>
  of the causal graphical model. In this paper, we first give an upper bound on the
  condition number for the interesting case of causal graphical models with small
  “confounded components”. We then develop a tight characterization of the condition
  number of any given causal identification problem. Finally, we use our tight characterization
  to give a specific example where the condition number can be much lower than that
  obtained via generic bounds on the condition number, and to show that even “equivalent”
  expressions for causal identification can behave very differently with respect to
  their numerical stability properties.
