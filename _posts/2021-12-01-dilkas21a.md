title: Weighted model counting with conditional weights for Bayesian networks
abstract: Weighted model counting (WMC) has emerged as the unifying inference mechanism
  across many (probabilistic) domains. Encoding an inference problem as an instance
  of WMC typically necessitates adding extra literals and clauses. This is partly
  so because the predominant definition of WMC assigns weights to models based on
  weights on literals, and this severely restricts what probability distributions
  can be represented. We develop a measure-theoretic perspective on WMC and propose
  a way to encode conditional weights on literals analogously to conditional probabilities.
  This representation can be as succinct as standard WMC with weights on literals
  but can also expand as needed to represent probability distributions with less structure.
  To demonstrate the performance benefits of conditional weights over the addition
  of extra literals, we develop a new WMC encoding for Bayesian networks and adapt
  a state-of-the-art WMC algorithm ADDMC to the new format. Our experiments show that
  the new encoding significantly improves the performance of the algorithm on most
  benchmark instances.
