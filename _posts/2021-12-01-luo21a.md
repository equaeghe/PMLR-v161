title: Hierarchical probabilistic model for blind source separation via Legendre transformation
abstract: We present a novel blind source separation (BSS) method, called information
  geometric blind source separation (IGBSS). Our formulation is based on the log-linear
  model equipped with a hierarchically structured sample space, which has theoretical
  guarantees to uniquely recover a set of source signals by minimizing the KL divergence
  from a set of mixed signals. Source signals, received signals, and mixing matrices
  are realized as different layers in our hierarchical sample space. Our empirical
  results have demonstrated on images and time series data that our approach is superior
  to well established techniques and is able to separate signals with complex interactions.
