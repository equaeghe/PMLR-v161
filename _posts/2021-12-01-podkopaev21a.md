title: Distribution-free uncertainty quantification for classification under label
  shift
abstract: Trustworthy deployment of ML models requires a proper measure of uncertainty,
  especially in safety-critical applications. We focus on uncertainty quantification
  (UQ) for classification problems via two avenues — prediction sets using conformal
  prediction and calibration of probabilistic predictors by post-hoc binning — since
  these possess distribution-free guarantees for i.i.d. data. Two common ways of generalizing
  beyond the i.i.d. setting include handling <em>covariate</em> and <em>label</em>
  shift. Within the context of distribution-free UQ, the former has already received
  attention, but not the latter. It is known that label shift hurts prediction, and
  we first argue that it also hurts UQ, by showing degradation in coverage and calibration.
  Piggybacking on recent progress in addressing label shift (for better prediction),
  we examine the right way to achieve UQ by reweighting the aforementioned conformal
  and calibration procedures whenever some unlabeled data from the target distribution
  is available. We examine these techniques theoretically in a distribution-free framework
  and demonstrate their excellent practical performance.
