title: Path dependent structural equation models
abstract: Causal analyses of longitudinal data generally assume that the qualitative
  causal structure relating variables remains invariant over time. In structured systems
  that transition between qualitatively different states in discrete time steps, such
  an approach is deficient on two fronts. First, time-varying variables may have state-specific
  causal relationships that need to be captured. Second, an intervention can result
  in state transitions downstream of the intervention different from those actually
  observed in the data. In other words, interventions may counterfactually alter the
  subsequent temporal evolution of the system.We introduce a generalization of causal
  graphical models, Path Dependent Structural Equation Models (PDSEMs), that can describe
  such systems. We show how causal inference may be performed in such models and illustrate
  its use in simulations and data obtained from a septoplasty surgical procedure.
