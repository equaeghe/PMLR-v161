title: Exact and approximate hierarchical clustering using A*
abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a critical task in numerous domains. Many approaches
  are based on heuristics and the properties of the resulting clusterings are studied
  post hoc. However, in several applications, there is a natural cost function that
  can be used to characterize the quality of the clustering. In those cases, hierarchical
  clustering can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem. To that end, we
  introduce a new approach based on A* search. We overcome the prohibitively large
  search space by combining A* with a novel <em>trellis</em> data structure. This
  results in an exact algorithm that scales beyond previous state of the art (from
  a search space with $10^{12}$ trees to $10^{15}$ trees) and an approximate algorithm
  that improves over baselines, even in enormous search spaces (that contain more
  than $10^{1000}$ trees). Empirically we demonstrate that our method achieves substantially
  higher quality results than baselines for a particle physics use case and other
  clustering benchmarks. We describe how our method provides significantly improved
  theoretical bounds on the time and space complexity of A* for clustering.
