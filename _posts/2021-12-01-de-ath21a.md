title: Asynchronous $ε$-Greedy Bayesian Optimisation
abstract: Batch Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a successful technique for the optimisation
  of expensive black-box functions. Asynchronous BO can reduce wallclock time by starting
  a new evaluation as soon as another finishes, thus maximising resource utilisation.
  To maximise resource allocation, we develop a novel asynchronous BO method, AEGiS
  (Asynchronous $\epsilon$-Greedy Global Search) that combines greedy search, exploiting
  the surrogate’s mean prediction, with Thompson sampling and random selection from
  the approximate Pareto set describing the trade-off between exploitation (surrogate
  mean prediction) and exploration (surrogate posterior variance). We demonstrate
  empirically the efficacy of AEGiS on synthetic benchmark problems, meta-surrogate
  hyperparameter tuning problems and real-world problems, showing that AEGiS generally
  outperforms existing methods for asynchronous BO. When a single worker is available
  performance is no worse than BO using expected improvement.
