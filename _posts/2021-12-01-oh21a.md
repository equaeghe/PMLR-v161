title: Mixed variable Bayesian optimization with frequency modulated kernels
abstract: The sample efficiency of Bayesian optimization(BO) is often boosted by Gaussian
  Process(GP) surrogate models. However, on mixed variable spaces, surrogate models
  other than GPs are prevalent, mainly due to the lack of kernels which can model
  complex dependencies across different types of variables. In this paper, we propose
  the frequency modulated(FM) kernel flexibly modeling dependencies among different
  types of variables, so that BO can enjoy the further improved sample efficiency.
  The FM kernel uses distances on continuous variables to modulate the graph Fourier
  spectrum derived from discrete variables. However, the frequency modulation does
  not always define a kernel with the similarity measure behavior which returns higher
  values for pairs of more similar points. Therefore, we specify and prove conditions
  for FM kernels to be positive definite and to exhibit the similarity measure behavior.
  In experiments, we demonstrate the improved sample efficiency of GP BO using FM
  kernels(BO-FM). On synthetic problems and hyperparameter optimization problems,
  BO-FM outperforms competitors consistently. Also, the importance of the frequency
  modulation principle is empirically demonstrated on the same problems. On joint
  optimization of neural architectures and SGD hyperparameters, BO-FM outperforms
  competitors including Regularized evolution(RE) and BOHB. Remarkably, BO-FM performs
  better even than RE andBOHB using three times as many evaluations.
