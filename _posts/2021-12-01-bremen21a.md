title: Faster lifting for two-variable logic using cell graphs
abstract: We consider the weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC) task, a problem
  with important applications to inference and learning in structured graphical models.
  Bringing together earlier work [Van den Broeck et al., 2011, 2014], a formal proof
  was given by Beame et al. [2015] showing that the two-variable fragment of first-order
  logic, FO^2, is domain-liftable, meaning it admits an algorithm for WFOMC whose
  runtime is polynomial in the given domain size. However, applying this theoretical
  upper bound is often impractical for real-world problem instances. We show how to
  adapt their proof into a fast algorithm for lifted inference in FO^2, using only
  off-the-shelf tools for knowledge compilation, and several careful optimizations
  involving the cell graph of the input sentence, a novel construct we define that
  encodes the interactions between the cells of the sentence. Experimental results
  show that, despite our approach being largely orthogonal to that of Forclift [Van
  den Broeck et al., 2011], our algorithm often outperforms it, scaling to larger
  domain sizes on more complex input sentences.
