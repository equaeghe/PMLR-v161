title: 'q-Paths: Generalizing the geometric annealing path using power means'
abstract: Many common machine learning methods involve the geometric annealing path,
  a sequence of intermediate densities between two distributions of interest constructed
  using the geometric average. While alternatives such as the moment-averaging path
  have demonstrated performance gains in some settings, their practical applicability
  remains limited by exponential family endpoint assumptions and a lack of closed
  form energy function. In this work, we introduce $q$-paths, a family of paths which
  is derived from a generalized notion of the mean, includes the geometric and arithmetic
  mixtures as special cases, and admits a simple closed form involving the deformed
  logarithm function from nonextensive thermodynamics. Following previous analysis
  of the geometric path, we interpret our $q$-paths as corresponding to a $q$-exponential
  family of distributions, and provide a variational representation of intermediate
  densities as minimizing a mixture of $\alpha$-divergences to the endpoints. We show
  that small deviations away from the geometric path yield empirical gains for Bayesian
  inference using Sequential Monte Carlo and generative model evaluation using Annealed
  Importance Sampling.
