title: Bayesian optimization for modular black-box systems with switching costs
abstract: Most existing black-box optimization methods assume that all variables in
  the system being optimized have equal cost and can change freely at each iteration.
  However, in many real-world systems, inputs are passed through a sequence of different
  operations or modules, making variables in earlier stages of processing more costly
  to update. Such structure induces a dynamic cost from switching variables in the
  early parts of a data processing pipeline. In this work, we propose a new algorithm
  for switch-cost-aware optimization called Lazy Modular Bayesian Optimization (LaMBO).
  This method efficiently identifies the global optimum while minimizing cost through
  a passive change of variables in early modules. The method is theoretically grounded
  which achieves a vanishing regret regularized with switching cost. We apply LaMBO
  to multiple synthetic functions and a three-stage image segmentation pipeline used
  in a neuroimaging task, where we obtain promising improvements over existing cost-aware
  Bayesian optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that LaMBO is an effective
  strategy for black-box optimization capable of minimizing switching costs.
