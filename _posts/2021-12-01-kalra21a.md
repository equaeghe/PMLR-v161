title: 'RISAN: Robust instance specific deep abstention network'
abstract: In this paper, we propose deep architectures for learning instance specific
  abstain (reject option) binary classifiers. The proposed approach uses double sigmoid
  loss function as described by Kulin Shah and Naresh Manwani in ("Online Active Learning
  of Reject Option Classifiers", AAAI, 2020), as a performance measure. We show that
  the double sigmoid loss is classification calibrated. We also show that the excess
  risk of 0-d-1 loss is upper bounded by the excess risk of double sigmoid loss. We
  derive the generalization error bounds for the proposed architecture for reject
  option classifiers. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we experiment
  with several real world datasets. We observe that the proposed approach not only
  performs comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches, it is also robust against
  label noise. We also provide visualizations to observe the important features learned
  by the network corresponding to the abstaining decision.
