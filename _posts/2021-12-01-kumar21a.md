title: Disentangling mixtures of unknown causal interventions
abstract: In many real-world scenarios, such as gene knockout experiments, targeted
  interventions are often accompanied by unknown interventions at off-target sites.
  Moreover, different units can get randomly exposed to different unknown interventions,
  thereby creating a mixture of interventions. Identifying different components of
  this mixture can be very valuable in some applications. Motivated by such situations,
  in this work, we study the problem of identifying all components present in a mixture
  of interventions on a given causal Bayesian Network. We construct examples to show
  that, in general, the components are not identifiable from the mixture distribution.
  Next, assuming that the given network satisfies a positivity condition, we show
  that, if the set of mixture components satisfy a mild exclusion assumption, then
  they can be uniquely identified. Our proof gives an efficient algorithm to recover
  these targets from the exponentially large search space of possible targets. In
  the more realistic scenario, where distributions are given via finitely many samples,
  we conduct a simulation study to analyze the performance of an algorithm derived
  from our identifiability proof.
