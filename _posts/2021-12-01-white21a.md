title: Exploring the loss landscape in neural architecture search
abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has seen a steep rise in interest over
  the last few years. Many algorithms for NAS consist of searching through a space
  of architectures by iteratively choosing an architecture, evaluating its performance
  by training it, and using all prior evaluations to come up with the next choice.
  The evaluation step is noisy - the final accuracy varies based on the random initialization
  of the weights. Prior work has focused on devising new search algorithms to handle
  this noise, rather than quantifying or understanding the level of noise in architecture
  evaluations. In this work, we show that (1) the simplest hill-climbing algorithm
  is a powerful baseline for NAS, and (2), when the noise in popular NAS benchmark
  datasets is reduced to a minimum, the loss landscape becomes near-convex, causing
  hill-climbing to outperform many popular state-of-the-art algorithms. We further
  back up this observation by showing that the number of local minima is substantially
  reduced as the noise decreases and by giving a theoretical characterization of the
  performance of local search in NAS. Based on our findings, for NAS research we suggest
  (1) using local search as a baseline, and (2) denoising the training pipeline when
  possible.
