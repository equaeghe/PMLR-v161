title: Invariant representation learning for treatment effect estimation
abstract: The defining challenge for causal inference from observational data is the
  presence of ‘confounders’, covariates that affect both treatment assignment and
  the outcome. To address this challenge, practitioners collect and adjust for the
  covariates, hoping that they adequately correct for confounding. However, including
  every observed covariate in the adjustment runs the risk of including ‘bad controls’,
  variables that <em>induce</em> bias when they are conditioned on. The problem is
  that we do not always know which variables in the covariate set are safe to adjust
  for and which are not. To address this problem, we develop Nearly Invariant Causal
  Estimation (NICE). NICE uses invariant risk minimization (IRM) [Arj19] to learn
  a representation of the covariates that, under some assumptions, strips out bad
  controls but preserves sufficient information to adjust for confounding. Adjusting
  for the learned representation, rather than the covariates themselves, avoids the
  induced bias and provides valid causal inferences. We evaluate NICE on both synthetic
  and semi-synthetic data. When the covariates contain unknown collider variables
  and other bad controls, NICE performs better than adjusting for all the covariates.
