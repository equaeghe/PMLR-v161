title: Graph-based semi-supervised learning through the lens of safety
abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (G-SSL) algorithms have witnessed rapid
  development and widespread usage across a variety of applications in recent years.
  However, the theoretical characterisation of the efficacy of such algorithms has
  remained an under-explored area. We introduce a novel algorithm for G-SSL, CSX,
  whose objective function extends those of Label Propagation and Expander, two popular
  G-SSL algorithms. We provide data-dependent generalisation error bounds for all
  three aforementioned algorithms when they are applied to graphs drawn from a partially
  labelled extension of a versatile latent space graph generative model. The bounds
  we obtain enable us to characterise the predictive performance as measured by accuracy
  in terms of homophily and label quantity. Building on this we develop a key notion
  of GLM-safety which enables us to compare G-SSL algorithms on the basis of the range
  of graphs on which they obtain a guaranteed accuracy. We show that the proposed
  algorithm CSX has a better GLM-safety profile than Label Propagation and Expander
  while achieving comparable or better accuracy on synthetic as well as real-world
  benchmark networks.
