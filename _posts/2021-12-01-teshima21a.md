title: Incorporating causal graphical prior knowledge into predictive modeling via
  simple data augmentation
abstract: Causal graphs (CGs) are compact representations of the knowledge of the
  data generating processes behind the data distributions. When a CG is available,
  e.g., from the domain knowledge, we can infer the conditional independence (CI)
  relations that should hold in the data distribution. However, it is not straightforward
  how to incorporate this knowledge into predictive modeling. In this work, we propose
  a model-agnostic data augmentation method that allows us to exploit the prior knowledge
  of the CI encoded in a CG for supervised machine learning. We theoretically justify
  the proposed method by providing an excess risk bound indicating that the proposed
  method suppresses overfitting by reducing the apparent complexity of the predictor
  hypothesis class. Using real-world data with CGs provided by domain experts, we
  experimentally show that the proposed method is effective in improving the prediction
  accuracy, especially in the small-data regime.
