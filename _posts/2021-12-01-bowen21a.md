title: 'Finite-time theory for momentum Q-learning '
abstract: Existing studies indicate that momentum ideas in conventional optimization
  can be used to improve the performance of Q-learning algorithms. However, the finite-time
  analysis for momentum-based Q-learning algorithms is only available for the tabular
  case without function approximation. This paper analyzes a class of momentum-based
  Q-learning algorithms with finite-time convergence guarantee. Specifically, we propose
  the MomentumQ algorithm, which integrates the Nesterov’s and Polyak’s momentum schemes,
  and generalizes the existing momentum-based Q-learning algorithms. For the infinite
  state-action space case, we establish the convergence guarantee for MomentumQ with
  linear function approximation under Markovian sampling. In particular, we characterize
  a finite-time convergence rate which is provably faster than the vanilla Q-learning.
  This is the first finite-time analysis for momentum-based Q-learning algorithms
  with function approximation. For the tabular case under synchronous sampling, we
  also obtain a finite-time convergence rate that is slightly better than the SpeedyQ
  (Azar et al., NIPS 2011). Finally, we demonstrate through various experiments that
  the proposed MomentumQ outperforms other momentum-based Q-learning algorithms.
