title: Improving uncertainty calibration of deep neural networks via truth discovery
  and geometric optimization
abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), despite their tremendous success in recent
  years, could still cast doubts on their predictions due to the intrinsic uncertainty
  associated with their learning process. Ensemble techniques and post-hoc calibrations
  are two types of approaches that have individually shown promise in improving the
  uncertainty calibration of DNNs. However, the synergistic effect of the two types
  of methods has not been well explored. In this paper, we propose a truth discovery
  framework to integrate ensemble-based and post-hoc calibration methods. Using the
  geometric variance of the ensemble candidates as a good indicator for sample uncertainty,
  we design an accuracy-preserving truth estimator with provably no accuracy drop.
  Furthermore, we show that post-hoc calibration can also be enhanced by truth discovery-regularized
  optimization. On large-scale datasets including CIFAR and ImageNet, our method shows
  consistent improvement against state-of-the-art calibration approaches on both histogram-based
  and kernel density-based evaluation metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/horsepurve/truly-uncertain.
