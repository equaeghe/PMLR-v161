title: 'Task similarity aware meta learning: theory-inspired improvement on MAML'
abstract: Few-shot learning ability is heavily desired for machine intelligence. By
  meta-learning a model initialization from training tasks with fast adaptation ability
  to new tasks, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has achieved remarkable success
  in a number of few-shot learning applications. However, theoretical understandings
  on the learning ability of MAML remain absent yet, hindering developing new and
  more advanced meta learning methods in a principled way. In this work, we solve
  this problem by theoretically justifying the fast adaptation capability of MAML
  when applied to new tasks. Specifically, we prove that the learnt meta-initialization
  can benefit the fast adaptation to new tasks with only a few steps of gradient descent.
  This result explicitly reveals the benefits of the unique designs in MAML. Then
  we propose a theory-inspired task similarity aware MAML which clusters tasks into
  multiple groups according to the estimated optimal model parameters and learns group-specific
  initializations. The proposed method improves upon MAML by speeding up the adaptation
  and giving stronger few-shot learning ability. Experimental results on the few-shot
  classification tasks testify its advantages.
