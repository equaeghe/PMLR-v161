title: Sequential core-set Monte Carlo
abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is a general-purpose methodology for recursive
  Bayesian inference, and is widely used in state space modeling and probabilistic
  programming. Its resample-move variant reduces the variance of posterior estimates
  by interleaving Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps for particle “rejuvenation”;
  but this requires accessing all past observations and leads to linearly growing
  memory size and quadratic computation cost. Under the assumption of exchangeability,
  we introduce sequential core-set Monte Carlo (SCMC), which achieves constant space
  and linear time by rejuvenating based on sparse, weighted subsets of past data.
  In contrast to earlier approaches, which uniformly subsample or throw away observations,
  SCMC uses a novel online version of a state-of-the-art Bayesian core-set algorithm
  to incrementally construct a nonparametric, data- and model-dependent variational
  representation of the unnormalized target density. Experiments demonstrate significantly
  reduced approximation errors at negligible additional cost.
