title: 'pRSL: Interpretable multi-label stacking by learning probabilistic rules'
abstract: A key task in multi-label classification is modeling the structure between
  the involved classes. Modeling this structure by probabilistic and interpretable
  means enables application in a broad variety of tasks such as zero-shot learning
  or learning from incomplete data. In this paper, we present the probabilistic rule
  stacking learner (pRSL) which uses probabilistic propositional logic rules and belief
  propagation to combine the predictions of several underlying classifiers. We derive
  algorithms for exact and approximate inference and learning, and show that pRSL
  reaches state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets. In the process,
  we introduce a novel multicategorical generalization of the noisy-or gate. Additionally,
  we report simulation results on the quality of loopy belief propagation algorithms
  for approximate inference in bipartite noisy-or networks.
