title: 'Stochastic continuous normalizing flows: training SDEs as ODEs'
abstract: We provide a general theoretical framework for stochastic continuous normalizing
  flows, an extension of continuous normalizing flows for density estimation of stochastic
  differential equations (SDEs). Using the theory of rough paths, the underlying Brownian
  motion is treated as a latent variable and approximated. Doing so enables the treatment
  of SDEs as random ordinary differential equations, which can be trained using existing
  techniques. For scalar loss functions, this approach naturally recovers the stochastic
  adjoint method of Li et al. [2020] for training neural SDEs, while supporting a
  more flexible class of approximations.
