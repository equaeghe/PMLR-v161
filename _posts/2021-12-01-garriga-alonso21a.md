title: Correlated weights in infinite limits of deep convolutional neural networks
abstract: Infinite width limits of deep neural networks often have tractable forms.
  They have been used to analyse the behaviour of finite networks, as well as being
  useful methods in their own right. When investigating infinitely wide convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs), it was observed that the correlations arising from spatial
  weight sharing disappear in the infinite limit. This is undesirable, as spatial
  correlation is the main motivation behind CNNs. We show that the loss of this property
  is not a consequence of the infinite limit, but rather of choosing an independent
  weight prior. Correlating the weights maintains the correlations in the activations.
  Varying the amount of correlation interpolates between independent-weight limits
  and mean-pooling. Empirical evaluation of the infinitely wide network shows that
  optimal performance is achieved between the extremes, indicating that correlations
  can be useful.
