title: Tractable computation of expected kernels
abstract: 'Computing the expectation of kernel functions is a ubiquitous task in machine
  learning, with applications from classical support vector machines to exploiting
  kernel embeddings of distributions in probabilistic modeling, statistical inference,
  causal discovery, and deep learning. In all these scenarios, we tend to resort to
  Monte Carlo estimates as expectations of kernels are intractable in general. In
  this work, we characterize the conditions under which we can compute expected kernels
  exactly and efficiently, by leveraging recent advances in probabilistic circuit
  representations. We first construct a circuit representation for kernels and propose
  an approach to such tractable computation. We then demonstrate possible advancements
  for kernel embedding frameworks by exploiting tractable expected kernels to derive
  new algorithms for two challenging scenarios: 1) reasoning under missing data with
  kernel support vector regressors; 2) devising a collapsed black-box importance sampling
  scheme. Finally, we empirically evaluate both algorithms and show that they outperform
  standard baselines on a variety of datasets.'
