title: A variational approximation for analyzing the dynamics of panel data
abstract: Panel data involving longitudinal measurements of the same set of participants
  or entities taken over multiple time points is common in studies to understand early
  childhood development and disease modeling. Deep hybrid models that marry the predictive
  power of neural networks with physical simulators such as differential equations,
  are starting to drive advances in such applications. The task of modeling not just
  the observations/data but the hidden dynamics that are captured by the measurements
  poses interesting statistical/computational questions. We propose a probabilistic
  model called ME-NODE to incorporate (fixed + random) mixed effects for analyzing
  such panel data. We show that our model can be derived using smooth approximations
  of SDEs provided by the Wong-Zakai theorem. We then derive Evidence Based Lower
  Bounds for ME-NODE, and develop (efficient) training algorithms using MC based sampling
  methods and numerical ODE solvers. We demonstrate ME-NODE’s utility on tasks spanning
  the spectrum from simulations and toy datasets to real longitudinal 3D imaging data
  from an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) study, and study the performance for accuracy of
  reconstruction for interpolation, uncertainty estimates and personalized prediction.
