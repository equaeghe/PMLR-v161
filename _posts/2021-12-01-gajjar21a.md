title: Generalized parametric path problems
abstract: Parametric path problems arise independently in diverse domains, ranging
  from transportation to finance, where they are studied under various assumptions.
  We formulate a general path problem with relaxed assumptions, and describe how this
  formulation is applicable in these domains. We study the complexity of the general
  problem, and a variant of it where preprocessing is allowed. We show that when the
  parametric weights are linear functions, algorithms remain tractable even under
  our relaxed assumptions. Furthermore, we show that if the weights are allowed to
  be non-linear, the problem becomes NP-hard. We also study the multi-dimensional
  version of the problem where the weight functions are parameterized by multiple
  parameters. We show that even with two parameters, this problem is NP-hard.
