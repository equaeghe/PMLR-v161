title: Structured sparsification with joint optimization of group convolution and
  channel shuffle
abstract: Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) usually come with
  the expense of excessive computational overhead and memory footprint. Network compression
  aims to alleviate this issue by training compact models with comparable performance.
  However, existing compression techniques either entail dedicated expert design or
  compromise with a moderate performance drop. In this paper, we propose a novel structured
  sparsification method for efficient network compression. The proposed method automatically
  induces structured sparsity on the convolutional weights, thereby facilitating the
  implementation of the compressed model with the highly-optimized group convolution.
  We further address the problem of inter-group communication with a learnable channel
  shuffle mechanism. The proposed approach can be easily applied to compress many
  network architectures with a negligible performance drop. Extensive experimental
  results and analysis demonstrate that our approach gives a competitive performance
  against the recent network compression counterparts with a sound accuracy-complexity
  trade-off.
