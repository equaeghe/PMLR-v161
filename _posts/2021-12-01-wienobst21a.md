title: 'Extendability of causal graphical models: Algorithms and computational complexity'
abstract: 'Finding a consistent DAG extension for a given partially directed acyclic
  graph (PDAG) is a basic building block used in graphical causal analysis. In 1992,
  Dor and Tarsi proposed an algorithm with time complexity O(n^4), which has been
  widely used in causal theory and practice so far. It is a long-standing open question
  whether an extension can be computed faster and, in particular, it was conjectured
  that a linear-time method may exist. The main contributions of our work are two-fold:
  Firstly, we propose a new algorithm for the extension problem for PDAGs which runs
  in time O(n^3); secondly, we show that, under a computational intractability assumption,
  our cubic algorithm is optimal. Thus, our impossibility result disproves the conjecture
  that a linear-time method exists. Based on these results, we present a full complexity
  landscape for finding extensions in various causal graphical models. We extend the
  techniques to recognition problems and apply them to design an effective algorithm
  for closing a PDAG under the orientation rules of Meek.'
