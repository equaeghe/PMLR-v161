title: Combining pseudo-point and state space approximations for sum-separable Gaussian
  Processes
abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are important probabilistic tools for inference
  and learning in spatio-temporal modelling problems such as those in climate science
  and epidemiology. However, existing GP approximations do not simultaneously support
  large numbers of off-the-grid spatial data-points and long time-series which is
  a hallmark of many applications. Pseudo-point approximations, one of the gold-standard
  methods for scaling GPs to large data sets, are well suited for handling off-the-grid
  spatial data. However, they cannot handle long temporal observation horizons effectively
  reverting to cubic computational scaling in the time dimension. State space GP approximations
  are well suited to handling temporal data, if the temporal GP prior admits a Markov
  form, leading to linear complexity in the number of temporal observations, but have
  a cubic spatial cost and cannot handle off-the-grid spatial data. In this work we
  show that there is a simple and elegant way to combine pseudo-point methods with
  the state space GP approximation framework to get the best of both worlds. The approach
  hinges on a surprising conditional independence property which applies to spaceâ€“time
  separable GPs. We demonstrate empirically that the combined approach is more scalable
  and applicable to a greater range of spatio-temporal problems than either method
  on its own.
