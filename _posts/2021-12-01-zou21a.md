title: Faster Convergence  of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics for Non-Log-Concave
  Sampling
abstract: We provide a new convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
  (SGLD) for sampling from a class of distributions that can be non-log-concave. At
  the core of our approach is a novel conductance analysis of SGLD using an auxiliary
  time-reversible Markov Chain. Under certain conditions on the target distribution,
  we prove that $\tilde O(d^4\epsilon^{-2})$ stochastic gradient evaluations suffice
  to guarantee $\epsilon$-sampling error in terms of the total variation distance,
  where $d$ is the problem dimension. This improves existing results on the convergence
  rate of SGLD [Raginsky et al., 2017, Xu et al., 2018]. We further show that provided
  an additional Hessian Lipschitz condition on the log-density function, SGLD is guaranteed
  to achieve $\epsilon$-sampling error within $\tilde O(d^{15/4}\epsilon^{-3/2})$
  stochastic gradient evaluations. Our proof technique provides a new way to study
  the convergence of Langevin based algorithms, and sheds some light on the design
  of fast stochastic gradient based sampling algorithms.
