title: Constrained differentially private federated learning for low-bandwidth devices
abstract: Federated learning becomes a prominent approach when different entities
  want to learn collaboratively a common model without sharing their training data.
  %Compared to traditional machine learning, it does not require to collect and centralize
  all data before training a common model. However, Federated learning has two main
  drawbacks. First, it is quite bandwidth inefficient as it involves a lot of message
  exchanges between the aggregating server and the participating entities. This bandwidth
  and corresponding processing costs could be prohibitive if the participating entities
  are, for example, mobile devices. Furthermore, although federated learning improves
  privacy by not sharing data, recent attacks have shown that it still leaks information
  about the training data. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving federated
  learning scheme. The proposed scheme provides theoretical privacy guarantees, as
  it is based on Differential Privacy. Furthermore, it optimizes the model accuracy
  by constraining the model learning phase on few selected weights. Finally, as shown
  experimentally, it reduces the upstream <em>and</em> downstream bandwidth by up
  to 99.9% compared to standard federated learning, making it practical for mobile
  systems.
