title: A Bayesian nonparametric conditional two-sample test with an application to
  Local Causal Discovery
abstract: For a continuous random variable $Z$, testing conditional independence $X\indep
  Y|Z$ is known to be a particularly hard problem. It constitutes a key ingredient
  of many constraint-based causal discovery algorithms. These algorithms are often
  applied to datasets containing binary variables, which indicate the ‘context’ of
  the observations, e.g. a control or treatment group within an experiment. In these
  settings, conditional independence testing with $X$ or $Y$ binary (and the other
  continuous) is paramount to the performance of the causal discovery algorithm. To
  our knowledge no nonparametric ‘mixed’ conditional independence test currently exists,
  and in practice tests that assume all variables to be continuous are used instead.
  In this paper we aim to fill this gap, as we combine elements of Holmes et al. (2015)
  and Teymur and Filippi (2020) to propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric conditional
  two-sample test. Applied to the Local Causal Discovery algorithm, we investigate
  its performance on both synthetic and real-world data, and compare with state-of-the-art
  conditional independence tests.
