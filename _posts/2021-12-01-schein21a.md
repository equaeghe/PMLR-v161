title: Doubly non-central beta matrix factorization for DNA methylation data
abstract: We present a new non-negative matrix factorization model for $(0,1)$ bounded-support
  data based on the doubly non-central beta (DNCB) distribution, a generalization
  of the beta distribution. The expressiveness of the DNCB distribution is particularly
  useful for modeling DNA methylation datasets, which are typically highly dispersed
  and multi-modal; however, the model structure is sufficiently general that it can
  be adapted to many other domains where latent representations of $(0,1)$ bounded-support
  data are of interest. Although the DNCB distribution lacks a closed-form conjugate
  prior, several augmentations let us derive an efficient posterior inference algorithm
  composed entirely of analytic updates. Our model improves out-of-sample predictive
  performance on both real and synthetic DNA methylation datasets over state-of-the-art
  methods in bioinformatics. In addition, our model yields meaningful latent representations
  that accord with existing biological knowledge.
