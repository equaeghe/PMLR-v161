title: Hierarchical infinite relational model
abstract: This paper describes the hierarchical infinite relational model (HIRM),
  a new probabilistic generative model for noisy, sparse, and heterogeneous relational
  data. Given a set of relations defined over a collection of domains, the model first
  infers multiple non-overlapping clusters of relations using a top-level Chinese
  restaurant process. Within each cluster of relations, a Dirichlet process mixture
  is then used to partition the domain entities and model the probability distribution
  of relation values. The HIRM generalizes the standard infinite relational model
  and can be used for a variety of data analysis tasks including dependence detection,
  clustering, and density estimation. We present new algorithms for fully Bayesian
  posterior inference via Gibbs sampling. We illustrate the efficacy of the method
  on a density estimation benchmark of twenty object-attribute datasets with up to
  18 million cells and use it to discover relational structure in real-world datasets
  from politics and genomics.
