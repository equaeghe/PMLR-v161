title: Natural language adversarial defense through synonym encoding
abstract: In the area of natural language processing, deep learning models are recently
  known to be vulnerable to various types of adversarial perturbations, but relatively
  few works are done on the defense side. Especially, there exists few effective defense
  method against the successful synonym substitution based attacks that preserve the
  syntactic structure and semantic information of the original text while fooling
  the deep learning models. We contribute in this direction and propose a novel adversarial
  defense method called <em>Synonym Encoding Method</em> (SEM). Specifically, SEM
  inserts an encoder before the input layer of the target model to map each cluster
  of synonyms to a unique encoding and trains the model to eliminate possible adversarial
  perturbations without modifying the network architecture or adding extra data. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that SEM can effectively defend the current synonym substitution
  based attacks and block the transferability of adversarial examples. SEM is also
  easy and efficient to scale to large models and big datasets.
