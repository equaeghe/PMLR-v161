title: Causal additive models with unobserved variables
abstract: Causal discovery from data affected by unobserved variables is an important
  but difficult problem to solve. The effects that unobserved variables have on the
  relationships between observed variables are more complex in nonlinear cases than
  in linear cases. In this study, we focus on causal additive models in the presence
  of unobserved variables. Causal additive models exhibit structural equations that
  are additive in the variables and error terms. We take into account the presence
  of not only unobserved common causes but also unobserved intermediate variables.
  Our theoretical results show that, when the causal relationships are nonlinear and
  there are unobserved variables, it is not possible to identify all the causal relationships
  between observed variables through regression and independence tests. However, our
  theoretical results also show that it is possible to avoid incorrect inferences.
  We propose a method to identify all the causal relationships that are theoretically
  possible to identify without being biased by unobserved variables. The empirical
  results using artificial data and simulated functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) data show that our method effectively infers causal structures in the presence
  of unobserved variables.
