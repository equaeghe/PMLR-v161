title: 'Sparse linear networks with a fixed butterfly structure: theory and practice'
abstract: A butterfly network consists of logarithmically many layers, each with a
  linear number of non-zero weights (pre-specified). The fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss
  transform (FJLT) can be represented as a butterfly network followed by a projection
  onto a random subset of the coordinates. Moreover, a random matrix based on FJLT
  with high probability approximates the action of any matrix on a vector. Motivated
  by these facts, we propose to replace a dense linear layer in any neural network
  by an architecture based on the butterfly network. The proposed architecture significantly
  improves upon the quadratic number of weights required in a standard dense layer
  to nearly linear with little compromise in expressibility of the resulting operator.
  In a collection of wide variety of experiments, including supervised prediction
  on both the NLP and vision data, we show that this not only produces results that
  match and at times outperform existing well-known architectures, but it also offers
  faster training and prediction in deployment. To understand the optimization problems
  posed by neural networks with a butterfly network, we also study the optimization
  landscape of the encoder-decoder network, where the encoder is replaced by a butterfly
  network followed by a dense linear layer in smaller dimension. Theoretical result
  presented in the paper explains why the training speed and outcome are not compromised
  by our proposed approach.
