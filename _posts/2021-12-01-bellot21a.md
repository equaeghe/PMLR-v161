title: Application of kernel hypothesis testing on set-valued data
abstract: 'We present a general framework for kernel hypothesis testing on distributions
  of sets of individual examples. Sets may represent many common data sources such
  as groups of observations in time series, collections of words in text or a batch
  of images of a given phenomenon. This observation pattern, however, differs from
  the common assumptions required for hypothesis testing: each set differs in size,
  may have differing levels of noise, and also may incorporate nuisance variability,
  irrelevant for the analysis of the phenomenon of interest; all features that bias
  test decisions if not accounted for. In this paper, we propose to interpret sets
  as independent samples from a collection of latent probability distributions, and
  introduce kernel two-sample and independence tests in this latent space of distributions.
  We prove the consistency of these tests and observe them to outperform in a wide
  range of synthetic and real data experiments, where previously heuristics were needed
  for feature extraction and testing.'
