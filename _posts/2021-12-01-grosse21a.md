title: Probabilistic DAG search
abstract: Exciting contemporary machine learning problems have recently been phrased
  in the classic formalism of tree search — most famously, the game of Go. Interestingly,
  the state-space underlying these sequential decision-making problems often posses
  a more general latent structure than can be captured by a tree. In this work, we
  develop a probabilistic framework to exploit a search space’s latent structure and
  thereby share information across the search tree. The method is based on a combination
  of approximate inference in jointly Gaussian models for the explored part of the
  problem, and an abstraction for the unexplored part that imposes a reduction of
  complexity ad hoc. We empirically find our algorithm to compare favorably to existing
  non-probabilistic alternatives in Tic-Tac-Toe and a feature selection application.
