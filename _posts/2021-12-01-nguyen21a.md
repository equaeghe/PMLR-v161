title: 'Most: multi-source domain adaptation via optimal transport for student-teacher
  learning'
abstract: 'Multi-source domain adaptation (DA) is more challenging than conventional
  DA because the knowledge is transferred from several source domains to a target
  domain. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model for multi-source DA
  using the theory of optimal transport and imitation learning. More specifically,
  our approach consists of two cooperative agents: a teacher classifier and a student
  classifier. The teacher classifier is a combined expert that leverages knowledge
  of domain experts that can be theoretically guaranteed to handle perfectly source
  examples, while the student classifier acting on the target domain tries to imitate
  the teacher classifier acting on the source domains. Our rigorous theory developed
  based on optimal transport makes this cross-domain imitation possible and also helps
  to mitigate not only the data shift but also the label shift, which are inherently
  thorny issues in DA research. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world
  datasets to demonstrate the merit of our approach and its optimal transport based
  imitation learning viewpoint. Experimental results show that our proposed method
  achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for multi-source domain
  adaptation including Digits-five, Office-Caltech10, and Office-31 to the best of
  our knowledge.'
