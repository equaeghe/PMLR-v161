title: 'Known unknowns: Learning novel concepts using reasoning-by-elimination'
abstract: People can learn new visual concepts without any samples, from information
  given by language or by deductive reasoning. For instance, people can use <em>elimination</em>
  to infer the meaning of novel labels from their context. While recognizing novel
  concepts was intensively studied in zero-shot learning with semantic descriptions,
  training models to learn by elimination is much less studied. Here we describe the
  first approach to train an agent to reason-by-elimination, by providing instructions
  that contain both familiar concepts and unfamiliar ones (“pick the red box and the
  green wambim”). In our framework, the agent combines a perception module with a
  reasoning module that includes internal memory. It uses reinforcement learning to
  construct a reasoning policy that, by considering all available items in a room,
  can make a correct inference even for never-seen objects or concepts. Furthermore,
  it can then perform one-shot learning and use newly learned concepts for inferring
  additional novel concepts. We evaluate this approach in a new set of environments,
  showing that agents successfully learn to reason by elimination, and can also learn
  novel concepts and use them for further reasoning. This approach paves the way to
  handle open-world environments by extending the abundant supervised learning approaches
  with reasoning frameworks that can handle novel concepts.
