title: The promises and pitfalls of deep kernel learning
abstract: Deep kernel learning and related techniques promise to combine the representational
  power of neural networks with the reliable uncertainty estimates of Gaussian processes.
  One crucial aspect of these models is an expectation that, because they are treated
  as Gaussian process models optimized using the marginal likelihood, they are protected
  from overfitting. However, we identify pathological behavior, including overfitting,
  on a simple toy example. We explore this pathology, explaining its origins and considering
  how it applies to real datasets. Through careful experimentation on UCI datasets,
  CIFAR-10, and the UTKFace dataset, we find that the overfitting from overparameterized
  deep kernel learning, in which the model is “somewhat Bayesian”, can in certain
  scenarios be worse than that from not being Bayesian at all. However, we find that
  a fully Bayesian treatment of deep kernel learning can rectify this overfitting
  and obtain the desired performance improvements over standard neural networks and
  Gaussian processes.
