title: Learning to learn with Gaussian processes
abstract: This paper presents Gaussian process meta-learning (GPML) for few-shot regression,
  which explicitly exploits the distance between regression problems/tasks using a
  novel task kernel. It contrasts sharply with the popular metric-based meta-learning
  approach which is based on the distance between data inputs or their embeddings
  in the few-shot learning literature. Apart from the superior predictive performance
  by capturing the diversity of different tasks, GPML offers a set of representative
  tasks that are useful for understanding the task distribution. We empirically demonstrate
  the performance and interpretability of GPML in several few-shot regression problems
  involving a multimodal task distribution and real-world datasets.
