title: 'Defending SVMs against poisoning attacks: the hardness and DBSCAN approach'
abstract: 'Adversarial machine learning has attracted a great amount of attention
  in recent years. Due to the great importance of support vector machines (SVM) in
  machine learning, we consider defending SVM against poisoning attacks in this paper.
  We study two commonly used strategies for defending: designing robust SVM algorithms
  and data sanitization. Though several robust SVM algorithms have been proposed before,
  most of them either are in lack of adversarial-resilience, or rely on strong assumptions
  about the data distribution or the attackerâ€™s behavior. Moreover, the research on
  the hardness of designing a quality-guaranteed adversarially-resilient SVM algorithm
  is still quite limited. We are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to prove
  that even the simplest hard-margin one-class SVM with adversarial outliers problem
  is NP-complete, and has no fully PTAS unless P=NP. For data sanitization, we explain
  the effectiveness of DBSCAN (as a density-based outlier removal method) for defending
  against poisoning attacks. In particular, we link it to the intrinsic dimensionality
  by proving a sampling theorem in doubling metrics. In our empirical experiments,
  we systematically compare several defenses including the DBSCAN and robust SVM methods,
  and investigate the influences from the intrinsic dimensionality and poisoned fraction
  to their performances.'
