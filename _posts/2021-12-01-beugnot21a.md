title: Improving approximate optimal transport distances using quantization
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a popular tool in machine learning to compare
  probability measures geometrically, but it comes with substantial computational
  burden. Linear programming algorithms for computing OT distances scale cubically
  in the size of the input, making OT impractical in the large-sample regime. We introduce
  a practical algorithm, which relies on a quantization step, to estimate OT distances
  between measures given cheap sample access. We also provide a variant of our algorithm
  to improve the performance of approximate solvers, focusing on those for entropy-regularized
  transport. We give theoretical guarantees on the benefits of this quantization step
  and display experiments showing that it behaves well in practice, providing a practical
  approximation algorithm that can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing OT
  estimators.
