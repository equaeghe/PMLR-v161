title: Uncertainty in minimum cost multicuts for image and motion segmentation
abstract: The minimum cost lifted multicut approach has proven practically good performance
  in a wide range of applications such as image decomposition, mesh segmentation,
  multiple object tracking and motion segmentation. It addresses such problems in
  a graph-based model, where real valued costs are assigned to the edges between entities
  such that the minimum cut decomposes the graph into an optimal number of segments.
  Driven by a probabilistic formulation of minimum cost multicuts, we provide a measure
  for the uncertainties of the decisions made during the optimization. We argue that
  the access to such uncertainties is crucial for many practical applications and
  conduct an evaluation by means of sparsifications on three different, widely used
  datasets in the context of image decomposition (BSDS-500) and motion segmentation
  (DAVIS$_{2016}$ and FBMS$_{59}$) in terms of variation of information (VI) and Rand
  index (RI).
