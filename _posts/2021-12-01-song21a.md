title: 'PLSO: A generative framework for decomposing nonstationary time-series into
  piecewise stationary oscillatory components'
abstract: To capture the slowly time-varying spectral content of real-world time-series,
  a common paradigm is to partition the data into approximately stationary intervals
  and perform inference in the time-frequency domain. However, this approach lacks
  a corresponding nonstationary time-domain generative model for the entire data and
  thus, time-domain inference occurs in each interval separately. This results in
  distortion/discontinuity around interval boundaries and can consequently lead to
  erroneous inferences based on any quantities derived from the posterior, such as
  the phase. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Piecewise Locally Stationary
  Oscillation (PLSO) model for decomposing time-series data with slowly time-varying
  spectra into several oscillatory, piecewise-stationary processes. PLSO, as a nonstationary
  time-domain generative model, enables inference on the entire time-series without
  boundary effects and simultaneously provides a characterization of its time-varying
  spectral properties. We also propose a novel two-stage inference algorithm that
  combines Kalman theory and an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We demonstrate
  these points through experiments on simulated data and real neural data from the
  rat and the human brain.
