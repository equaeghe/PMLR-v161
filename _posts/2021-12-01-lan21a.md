title: Hierarchical learning of Hidden Markov Models with clustering regularization
abstract: Hierarchical learning of generative models is useful for representing and
  interpreting complex data. For instance, one application is to learn an HMM to represent
  an individual’s eye fixations on a stimuli, and then cluster individuals’ HMMs to
  discover common eye gaze strategies. However, learning the individual representation
  models from observations and clustering individual models to group models are often
  considered as two separate tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel tree structure
  variational Bayesian method to learn the individual model and group model simultaneously
  by treating the group models as the parents of individual models, so that the individual
  model is learned from observations and regularized by its parents, and conversely,
  the parent model will be optimized to best represent its children. Due to the regularization
  process, our method has advantages when the number of training samples decreases.
  Experimental results on the synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
  the proposed method.
