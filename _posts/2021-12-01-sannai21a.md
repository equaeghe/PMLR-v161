title: Improved generalization bounds of group invariant / equivariant deep networks
  via quotient feature spaces
abstract: Numerous invariant (or equivariant) neural networks have succeeded in handling
  the invariant data such as point clouds and graphs. However, a generalization theory
  for the neural networks has not been well developed, because several essential factors
  for the theory, such as network size and margin distribution, are not deeply connected
  to the invariance and equivariance. In this study, we develop a novel generalization
  error bound for invariant and equivariant deep neural networks. To describe the
  effect of invariance and equivariance on generalization, we develop a notion of
  a <em>quotient feature space</em>, which measures the effect of group actions for
  the properties. Our main result proves that the volume of quotient feature spaces
  can describe the generalization error. Furthermore, the bound shows that the invariance
  and equivariance significantly improves the leading term of the bound. We apply
  our result to a specific invariant and equivariant networks, such as DeepSets (Zaheer
  et al., NIPS 2017), and show that their generalization bound is considerably improved
  by $\sqrt{n!}$, where $n!$ is the number of permutations. We also discuss the expressive
  power of invariant DNNs and show that they can achieve an optimal approximation
  rate. Moreover, we conducted experiments to support our results.
