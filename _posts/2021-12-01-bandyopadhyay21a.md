title: Unsupervised constrained community detection via self-expressive graph neural
  network
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are able to achieve promising performance on
  multiple graph downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.
  Comparatively lesser work has been done to design GNNs which can operate directly
  for community detection on graphs. Traditionally, GNNs are trained on a semi-supervised
  or self-supervised loss function and then clustering algorithms are applied to detect
  communities. However, such decoupled approaches are inherently sub-optimal. Designing
  an unsupervised loss function to train a GNN and extract communities in an integrated
  manner is a fundamental challenge. To tackle this problem, we combine the principle
  of self-expressiveness with the framework of self-supervised graph neural network
  for unsupervised community detection for the first time in literature. Our solution
  is trained in an end-to-end fashion and achieves state-of-the-art community detection
  performance on multiple publicly available datasets.
