title: A unifying framework for observer-aware planning and its complexity
abstract: Being aware of observers and the inferences they make about an agentâ€™s behavior
  is crucial for successful multi-agent interaction. Existing works on observer-aware
  planning use different assumptions and techniques to produce observer-aware behaviors.
  We argue that observer-aware planning, in its most general form, can be modeled
  as an Interactive POMDP (I-POMDP), which requires complex modeling and is hard to
  solve. Hence, we introduce a less complex framework for producing observer-aware
  behaviors called Observer-Aware MDP (OAMDP) and analyze its relationship to I-POMDP.
  We establish the complexity of OAMDPs and show that they can improve interpretability
  of agent behaviors in several scenarios.
