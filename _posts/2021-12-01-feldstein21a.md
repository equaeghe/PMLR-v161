title: Lifted reasoning meets weighted model integration
abstract: Exact inference in probabilistic graphical models is particularly challenging
  in the presence of relational and other deterministic constraints. For discrete
  domains, weighted model counting has emerged as an effective and general approach
  in a variety of formalisms. Weighted first-order model counting, which allows relational
  atoms and function-free first order logic has pushed the envelope further, by exploiting
  symmetry properties over indistinguishable groups of objects, and by extension avoids
  the need to perform inference on the exponential ground theory. Given the limitation
  to discrete domains, the formulation of weighted model integration was proposed
  as an extension to weighted model counting for mixed discrete-continuous domains
  over both symbolic and numeric weight functions. While that formulation has enjoyed
  considerable attention in recent years, there is very little understanding on whether
  the task can be solved at a lifted level, that is, whether we can reason with relational
  models by avoiding grounding. In this paper, we consider this question. We show
  how to generalize algorithmic ideas known in the circuit compilation for function-free
  lifted inference to functions with a continuous range.
