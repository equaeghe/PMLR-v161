title: Bias-corrected peaks-over-threshold estimation of the CVaR
abstract: The conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is a useful risk measure in fields
  such as machine learning, finance, insurance, energy, etc. When measuring very extreme
  risk, the commonly used CVaR estimation method of sample averaging does not work
  well due to limited data above the value-at-risk (VaR), the quantile corresponding
  to the CVaR level. To mitigate this problem, the CVaR can be estimated by extrapolating
  above a lower threshold than the VaR using a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD),
  which is often referred to as the peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach. This method
  often requires a very high threshold to fit well, leading to high variance in estimation,
  and can induce significant bias if the threshold is chosen too low. In this paper,
  we address this bias-variance tradeoff by deriving a new expression for the GPD
  approximation error of the CVaR, a bias term induced by the choice of threshold,
  as well as a bias correction method for the estimated GPD parameters. This leads
  to the derivation of a new CVaR estimator that is asymptotically unbiased and less
  sensitive to lower thresholds being used. An asymptotic confidence interval for
  the estimator is also constructed. In a practical setting, we show through experiments
  that our estimator provides a significant performance improvement compared with
  competing CVaR estimators in finite samples from heavy-tailed distributions.
