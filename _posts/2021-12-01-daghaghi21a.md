title: 'SDM-Net: A simple and effective model for generalized zero-shot learning'
abstract: Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is a classification task where some classes referred
  to as <em>unseen classes</em> have no training images. Instead, we only have side
  information about seen and unseen classes, often in the form of semantic or descriptive
  attributes. Lack of training images from a set of classes restricts the use of standard
  classification techniques and losses, including the widespread cross-entropy loss.
  We introduce a novel Similarity Distribution Matching Network (SDM-Net) which is
  a standard fully connected neural network architecture with a non-trainable penultimate
  layer consisting of class attributes. The output layer of SDM-Net consists of both
  seen and unseen classes. To enable zero-shot learning, during training, we regularize
  the model such that the predicted distribution of unseen class is close in KL divergence
  to the distribution of similarities between the correct seen class and all the unseen
  classes. We evaluate the proposed model on five benchmark datasets for zero-shot
  learning, AwA1, AwA2, aPY, SUN, and CUB datasets. We show that, despite the simplicity,
  our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in Generalized-ZSL
  setting for all of these datasets.
