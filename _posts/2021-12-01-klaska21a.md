title: 'Regstar: efficient strategy synthesis for adversarial patrolling games'
abstract: We design a new efficient strategy synthesis method applicable to adversarial
  patrolling problems on graphs with arbitrary-length edges and possibly imperfect
  intrusion detection. The core ingredient is an efficient algorithm for computing
  the value and the gradient of a function assigning to every strategy its “protection”
  achieved. This allows for designing an efficient strategy improvement algorithm
  by differentiable programming and optimization techniques. Our method is the first
  one applicable to real-world patrolling graphs of reasonable sizes. It outperforms
  the state-of-the-art strategy synthesis algorithm by a margin.
