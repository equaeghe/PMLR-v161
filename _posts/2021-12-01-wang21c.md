title: 'CORe: Capitalizing On Rewards in Bandit Exploration'
abstract: We propose a bandit algorithm that explores purely by randomizing its past
  observations. In particular, the sufficient optimism in the mean reward estimates
  is achieved by exploiting the variance in the past observed rewards. We name the
  algorithm Capitalizing On Rewards (CORe). The algorithm is general and can be easily
  applied to different bandit settings. The main benefit of CORe is that its exploration
  is fully data-dependent. It does not rely on any external noise and adapts to different
  problems without parameter tuning. We derive a $\tilde O(d\sqrt{n\log K})$ gap-free
  bound on the n-round regret of CORe in a stochastic linear bandit, where d is the
  number of features and K is the number of arms. Extensive empirical evaluation on
  multiple synthetic and real-world problems demonstrates the effectiveness of CORe.
