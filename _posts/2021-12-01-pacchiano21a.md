title: Towards tractable optimism in model-based reinforcement learning
abstract: 'The principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty is prevalent throughout
  sequential decision making problems such as multi-armed bandits and reinforcement
  learning (RL). To be successful, an optimistic RL algorithm must over-estimate the
  true value function (optimism) but not by so much that it is inaccurate (estimation
  error). In the tabular setting, many state-of-the-art methods produce the required
  optimism through approaches which are intractable when scaling to deep RL. We re-interpret
  these scalable optimistic model-based algorithms as solving a tractable noise augmented
  MDP. This formulation achieves a competitive regret bound: $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(
  |\mathcal{S}|H\sqrt{|\mathcal{A}| T } )$ when augmenting using Gaussian noise, where
  $T$ is the total number of environment steps. We also explore how this trade-off
  changes in the deep RL setting, where we show empirically that estimation error
  is significantly more troublesome. However, we also show that if this error is reduced,
  optimistic model-based RL algorithms can match state-of-the-art performance in continuous
  control problems.'
