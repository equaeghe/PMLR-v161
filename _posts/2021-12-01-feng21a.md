title: Non-PSD matrix sketching with applications to regression and optimization
abstract: A variety of dimensionality reduction techniques have been applied for computations
  involving large matrices. The underlying matrix is randomly compressed into a smaller
  one, while approximately retaining many of its original properties. As a result,
  much of the expensive computation can be performed on the small matrix. The sketching
  of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices is well understood, but there are many applications
  where the related matrices are not PSD, including Hessian matrices in non-convex
  optimization and covariance matrices in regression applications involving complex
  numbers. In this paper, we present novel dimensionality reduction methods for non-PSD
  matrices, as well as their "square-roots", which involve matrices with complex entries.
  We show how these techniques can be used for multiple downstream tasks. In particular,
  we show how to use the proposed matrix sketching techniques for both convex and
  non-convex optimization, lp-regression for every 1<=p<infinity, and vector-matrix-vector
  queries.
