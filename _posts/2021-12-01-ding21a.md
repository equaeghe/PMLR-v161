title: 'XOR-SGD: provable convex stochastic optimization for decision-making under
  uncertainty'
abstract: 'Many decision-making problems under uncertainty can be formulated as convex
  stochastic optimization, which minimizes a convex objective in expectation across
  exponentially many probabilistic scenarios. Despite its convexity, evaluating the
  objective function is #P-hard. Previous approaches use samples from MCMC and its
  variants to approximate the objective function but have a slow mixing rate. We present
  XOR-SGD, a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach guaranteed to converge to
  solutions that are at most a constant away from the true optimum in linear number
  of iterations. XOR-SGD harnesses XOR-sampling, which reduces the sample approximation
  of the expectation into queries of NP oracles via hashing and projection. We evaluate
  XOR-SGD on two real-world applications. The first stochastic inventory management
  problem searches for a robust inventory management plan in preparation for the virus
  pandemics, natural disasters, etc. The second network design problem decides an
  optimal land conservation plan which promotes the free movement of wild-life animals.
  We show that our approach finds better solutions with drastically fewer samples
  needed compared to a couple of state-of-the-art solvers.'
