title: Dimension reduction for data with heterogeneous missingness
abstract: Dimension reduction plays a pivotal role in analysing high-dimensional data.
  However, observations with missing values present serious difficulties in directly
  applying standard dimension reduction techniques. As a large number of dimension
  reduction approaches are based on the Gram matrix, we first investigate the effects
  of missingness on dimension reduction by studying the statistical properties of
  the Gram matrix with or without missingness, and then we present a bias-corrected
  Gram matrix with nice statistical properties under heterogeneous missingness. Extensive
  empirical results, on both simulated and publicly available real datasets, show
  that the proposed unbiased Gram matrix can significantly improve a broad spectrum
  of representative dimension reduction approaches.
