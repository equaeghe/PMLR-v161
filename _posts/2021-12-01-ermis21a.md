title: Towards robust episodic meta-learning
abstract: Meta-learning learns across historical tasks with the goal to discover a
  representation from which it is easy to adapt to unseen tasks. Episodic meta-learning
  attempts to simulate a realistic setting by generating a set of small artificial
  tasks from a larger set of training tasks for meta-training and proceeds in a similar
  fashion for meta-testing. However, this (meta-)learning paradigm has recently been
  shown to be brittle, suggesting that the inductive bias encoded in the learned representations
  is inadequate. In this work we propose to compose episodes to robustify meta-learning
  in the few-shot setting in order to learn more efficiently and to generalize better
  to new tasks. We make use of active learning scoring rules to select the data to
  be included in the episodes. We assume that the meta-learner is given new tasks
  at random, but the data associated to the tasks can be selected from a larger pool
  of unlabeled data, and investigate where active learning can boost the performance
  of episodic meta-learning. We show that instead of selecting samples at random,
  it is better to select samples in an active manner especially in settings with out-of-distribution
  and class-imbalanced tasks. We evaluate our method with Prototypical Networks, foMAML
  and protoMAML, reporting significant improvements on public benchmarks.
