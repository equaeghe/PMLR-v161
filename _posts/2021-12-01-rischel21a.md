title: Compositional abstraction error and a category of causal models
abstract: 'Interventional causal models describe several joint distributions over
  some variables used to describe a system, one for each intervention setting. They
  provide a formal recipe for how to move between the different joint distributions
  and make predictions about the variables upon intervening on the system. Yet, it
  is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying variables used to describe
  the system, say moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained variables. Here, we argue
  that compositionality is a desideratum for such model transformations and the associated
  errors: When abstracting a reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M’ and
  then further simplifying that to obtain M”, we expect the composite transformation
  from M to M” to exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each
  individual transformation step. Category theory, the study of mathematical objects
  via compositional transformations between them, offers a natural language to develop
  our framework for model transformations and abstractions. We introduce a category
  of finite interventional causal models and, leveraging theory of enriched categories,
  prove the desired compositionality properties for our framework.'
