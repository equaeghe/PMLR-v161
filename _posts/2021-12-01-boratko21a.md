title: Min/max stability and box distributions
abstract: In representation learning, capturing correlations between the represented
  elements is paramount. A recent line of work introduces the notion of learning region-based
  representations, with the objective of being able to better capture these correlations
  as set interactions. Box models use regions which are products of intervals on $[0,1]$
  (i.e., "boxes"), representing joint probability distributions via Lebesgue measure.
  To mitigate issues with training, a recent work models the endpoints of these intervals
  using Gumbel distributions, chosen due to their min/max-stability. In this work
  we analyze min/max-stability on a bounded domain and provide a specific family of
  such distributions which, replacing Gumbel, allow for stochastic boxes embedded
  in a finite measure space. This allows for a latent noise model which is a probability
  measure. Furthermore, we demonstrate an equivalence between this region-based representation
  and a density representation, where intersection is given by products of densities.
  We compare our model to previous region-based probability models, and demonstrate
  it is capable of being trained effectively to modeling correlations.
