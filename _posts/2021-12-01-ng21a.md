title: Generative Archimedean copulas
abstract: We propose a new generative modeling technique for learning multidimensional
  cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) in the form of copulas. Specifically, we
  consider certain classes of copulas known as Archimedean and hierarchical Archimedean
  copulas, popular for their parsimonious representation and ability to model different
  tail dependencies. We consider their representation as mixture models with Laplace
  transforms of latent random variables from generative neural networks. This alternative
  representation allows for computational efficiencies and easy sampling, especially
  in high dimensions. We describe multiple methods for optimizing the network parameters.
  Finally, we present empirical results that demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
  method in learning multidimensional CDFs and its computational efficiency compared
  to existing methods.
