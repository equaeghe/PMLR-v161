title: Possibilistic preference elicitation by minimax regret
abstract: 'Identifying the preferences of a given user through elicitation is a central
  part of multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) or preference learning tasks. Two classical
  ways to perform this elicitation is to use either a robust or a Bayesian approach.
  However, both have their shortcoming: the robust approach has strong guarantees
  through very strong hypotheses, but cannot integrate uncertain information. While
  the Bayesian approach can integrate uncertainties, but sacrifices the previous guarantees
  and asks for stronger model assumptions. In this paper, we propose and test a method
  based on possibility theory, which keeps the guarantees of the robust approach without
  needing its strong hypotheses. Among other things, we show that it can detect user
  errors as well as model misspecification.'
