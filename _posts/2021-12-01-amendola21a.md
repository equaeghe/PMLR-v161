title: Markov equivalence of max-linear Bayesian networks
abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks have emerged as highly applicable models for
  causal inference from extreme value data. However, conditional independence (CI)
  for max-linear Bayesian networks behaves differently than for classical Gaussian
  Bayesian networks. We establish the parallel between the two theories via tropicalization,
  and establish the surprising result that the Markov equivalence classes for max-linear
  Bayesian networks coincide with the ones obtained by regular CI. Our paper opens
  up many open problems at the intersection of extreme value statistics, causal inference
  and tropical geometry.
