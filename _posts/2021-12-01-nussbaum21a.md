title: Robust principal component analysis for generalized multi-view models
abstract: It has long been known that principal component analysis (PCA) is not robust
  with respect to gross data corruption. This has been addressed by robust principal
  component analysis (RPCA). The first computationally tractable definition of RPCA
  decomposes a data matrix into a low-rank and a sparse component. The low-rank component
  represents the principal components, while the sparse component accounts for the
  data corruption. Previous works consider the corruption of individual entries or
  whole columns of the data matrix. In contrast, we consider a more general form of
  data corruption that affects groups of measurements. We show that the decomposition
  approach remains computationally tractable and allows the exact recovery of the
  decomposition when only the corrupted data matrix is given. Experiments on synthetic
  data corroborate our theoretical findings, and experiments on several real-world
  datasets from different domains demonstrate the wide applicability of our generalized
  approach.
