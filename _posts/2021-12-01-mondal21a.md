title: 'FlexAE: flexibly learning latent priors for wasserstein auto-encoders'
abstract: Auto-Encoder (AE) based neural generative frameworks model the joint-distribution
  between the data and the latent space using an Encoder-Decoder pair, with regularization
  imposed in terms of a prior over the latent space. Despite their advantages, such
  as stability in training, efficient inference, the performance of AE based models
  has not reached the superior standards of the other generative models such as Generative
  Adversarial Networks (GANs). Motivated by this, we examine the effect of the latent
  prior on the generation quality of deterministic AE models in this paper. Specifically,
  we consider the class of Generative AE models with deterministic Encoder-Decoder
  pair (such as Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE), Adversarial Auto-Encoder (AAE)), and
  show that having a fixed prior distribution, <em>a priori</em>, oblivious to the
  dimensionality of the ‘true’ latent space, will lead to the infeasibility of the
  optimization problem considered. As a remedy to the issue mentioned above, we introduce
  an additional state space in the form of flexibly learnable latent priors, in the
  optimization objective of WAE/AAE. Additionally, we employ a latent-space interpolation
  based smoothing scheme to address the non-smoothness that may arise from highly
  flexible priors. We show the efficacy of our proposed models, called FlexAE and
  FlexAE-SR, through several experiments on multiple datasets, and demonstrate that
  FlexAE-SR is the new state-of-the-art for the AE based generative models in terms
  of generation quality as measured by several metrics such as Fr\’echet Inception
  Distance, Precision/Recall score.
