title: 'NP-DRAW: A Non-Parametric Structured Latent Variable Model for Image Generation'
abstract: In this paper, we present a non-parametric structured latent variable model
  for image generation, called NP-DRAW, which sequentially draws on a latent canvas
  in a part-by-part fashion and then decodes the image from the canvas. Our key contributions
  are as follows. 1) We propose a non-parametric prior distribution over the appearance
  of image parts so that the latent variable “what-to-draw” per step becomes a categorical
  random variable. This improves the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning
  compared to Gaussians used in the literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency
  structure of parts via a Transformer, which is more powerful and easier to train
  compared to RNNs used in the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing
  algorithm to pre-train the prior. Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and
  CelebA show that our method significantly outperforms previous structured image
  models like DRAW and AIR and is competitive to other generic generative models.
  Moreover, we show that our model’s inherent compositionality and interpretability
  bring significant benefits in the low-data learning regime and latent space editing.
