title: Probabilistic selection of inducing points in sparse Gaussian processes
abstract: Sparse Gaussian processes and various extensions thereof are enabled through
  inducing points, that simultaneously bottleneck the predictive capacity and act
  as the main contributor towards model complexity. However, the number of inducing
  points is generally not associated with uncertainty which prevents us from applying
  the apparatus of Bayesian reasoning for identifying an appropriate trade-off. In
  this work we place a point process prior on the inducing points and approximate
  the associated posterior through stochastic variational inference. By letting the
  prior encourage a moderate number of inducing points, we enable the model to learn
  which and how many points to utilise. We experimentally show that fewer inducing
  points are preferred by the model as the points become less informative, and further
  demonstrate how the method can be employed in deep Gaussian processes and latent
  variable modelling.
