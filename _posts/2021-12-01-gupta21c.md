title: Integer programming-based error-correcting output code design for robust classification
abstract: Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOCs) offer a principled approach for combining
  binary classifiers into multiclass classifiers. In this paper, we study the problem
  of designing optimal ECOCs to achieve both nominal and adversarial accuracy using
  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and binary deep neural networks. We develop a scalable
  Integer Programming (IP) formulation to design minimal codebooks with desirable
  error correcting properties. Our work leverages the advances in IP solution techniques
  to generate codebooks with optimality guarantees. To achieve tractability, we exploit
  the underlying graph-theoretic structure of the constraint set. Particularly, the
  size of the constraint set can be significantly reduced using edge clique covers.
  Using this reduction technique along with Plotkinâ€™s bound in coding theory, we demonstrate
  that our approach is scalable to a large number of classes. The resulting codebooks
  achieve a high nominal accuracy relative to standard codebooks (e.g., one-vs-all,
  one-vs-one, and dense/sparse codes). Interestingly, our codebooks provide non-trivial
  robustness to white-box attacks without any adversarial training.
