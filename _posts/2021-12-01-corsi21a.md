title: Formal verification of neural networks for safety-critical tasks in deep reinforcement
  learning
abstract: In the last years, neural networks achieved groundbreaking successes in
  a wide variety of applications. However, for safety critical tasks, such as robotics
  and healthcare, it is necessary to provide some specific guarantees before the deployment
  in a real world context. Even in these scenarios, where high cost equipment and
  human safety are involved, the evaluation of the models is usually performed with
  the standard metrics (i.e., cumulative reward or success rate). In this paper, we
  introduce a novel metric for the evaluation of models in safety critical tasks,
  the <em>violation rate</em>. We build our work upon the concept of formal verification
  for neural networks, providing a new formulation for the safety properties that
  aims to ensure that the agent always makes rational decisions. To perform this evaluation,
  we present ProVe (Property Verifier), a novel approach based on the interval algebra,
  designed for the analysis of our novel <em>behavioral</em> properties. We apply
  our method to different domains (i.e., mapless navigation for mobile robots, trajectory
  generation for manipulators, and the standard ACAS benchmark). Results show that
  the violation rate computed by ProVe provides a good evaluation for the safety of
  trained models.
