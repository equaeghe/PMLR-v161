title: 'Gaussian process nowcasting: application to COVID-19 mortality reporting'
abstract: 'Updating observations of a signal due to the delays in the measurement
  process is a common problem in signal processing, with prominent examples in a wide
  range of fields. An important example of this problem is the nowcasting of COVID-19
  mortality: given a stream of reported counts of daily deaths, can we correct for
  the delays in reporting to paint an accurate picture of the present, with uncertainty?
  Without this correction, raw data will often mislead by suggesting an improving
  situation. We present a flexible approach using a latent Gaussian process that is
  capable of describing the changing auto-correlation structure present in the reporting
  time-delay surface. This approach also yields robust estimates of uncertainty for
  the estimated nowcasted numbers of deaths. We test assumptions in model specification
  such as the choice of kernel or hyper priors, and evaluate model performance on
  a challenging real dataset from Brazil. Our experiments show that Gaussian process
  nowcasting performs favourably against both comparable methods, and against a small
  sample of expert human predictions. Our approach has substantial practical utility
  in disease modelling â€” by applying our approach to COVID-19 mortality data from
  Brazil, where reporting delays are large, we can make informative predictions on
  important epidemiological quantities such as the current effective reproduction
  number.'
