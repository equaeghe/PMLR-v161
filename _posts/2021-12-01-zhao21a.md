title: 'BayLIME: Bayesian local interpretable model-agnostic explanations'
abstract: Given the pressing need for assuring algorithmic transparency, Explainable
  AI (XAI) has emerged as one of the key areas of AI research. In this paper, we develop
  a novel Bayesian extension to the LIME framework, one of the most widely used approaches
  in XAI â€“ which we call BayLIME. Compared to LIME, BayLIME exploits prior knowledge
  and Bayesian reasoning to improve both the consistency in repeated explanations
  of a single prediction and the robustness to kernel settings. BayLIME also exhibits
  better explanation fidelity than the state-of-the-art (LIME, SHAP and GradCAM) by
  its ability to integrate prior knowledge from, e.g., a variety of other XAI techniques,
  as well as verification and validation (V&V) methods. We demonstrate the desirable
  properties of BayLIME through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.
