title: A decentralized policy gradient approach to multi-task reinforcement learning
abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for solving multi-task reinforcement
  learning (MTRL) problems based on a type of policy gradient method. The goal in
  MTRL is to learn a common policy that operates effectively in different environments;
  these environments have similar (or overlapping) state spaces, but have different
  rewards and dynamics. We highlight two fundamental challenges in MTRL that are not
  present in its single task counterpart, and illustrate them with simple examples.
  We then develop a decentralized entropyregularized policy gradient method for solving
  the MTRL problem, and study its finite-time convergence rate. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the proposed method using a series of numerical experiments. These
  experiments range from small-scale "GridWorld" problems that readily demonstrate
  the trade-offs involved in multi-task learning to large-scale problems, where common
  policies are learned to navigate an airborne drone in multiple (simulated) environments.
