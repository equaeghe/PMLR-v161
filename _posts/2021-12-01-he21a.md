title: Tighter Generalization Bounds for Iterative Differentially Private Learning
  Algorithms
abstract: This paper studies the relationship between generalization and privacy preservation
  of machine learning in two steps. We first establish an alignment between the two
  facets for any learning algorithm. We prove that $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential
  privacy implies an on-average generalization bound for a multi-sample-set learning
  algorithm, which further leads to a high-probability bound for any learning algorithm.
  We then investigate how the iterative nature shared by most learning algorithms
  influences privacy preservation and further generalization. Three composition theorems
  are proved to approximate the differential privacy of an iterative algorithm through
  the differential privacy of its every iteration. Integrating the above two steps,
  we eventually deliver generalization bounds for iterative learning algorithms. Our
  results are strictly tighter than the existing works. Particularly, our generalization
  bounds do not rely on the model size which is prohibitively large in deep learning.
  Experiments of MLP, VGG, and ResNet on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 are in full
  agreement with our theory. The theory applies to a wide spectrum of learning algorithms.
  In this paper, it is applied to the Gaussian mechanism as an example.
