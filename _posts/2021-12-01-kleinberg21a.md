title: Stochastic model for sunk cost bias
abstract: 'We present a novel model for capturing the behavior of an agent exhibiting
  sunk-cost bias in a stochastic environment. Agents exhibiting sunk-cost bias take
  into account the effort they have already spent on an endeavor when they evaluate
  whether to continue or abandon it. We model planning tasks in which an agent with
  this type of bias tries to reach a designated goal. Our model structures this problem
  as a type of Markov decision process: loosely speaking, the agent traverses a directed
  acyclic graph with probabilistic transitions, paying costs for its actions as it
  tries to reach a target node containing a specified reward. The agentâ€™s sunk cost
  bias is modeled by a cost that it incurs for abandoning the traversal: if the agent
  decides to stop traversing the graph, it incurs a cost of $\lambda \cdot C_{sunk}$,
  where ${\lambda \geq 0}$ is a parameter that captures the extent of the bias and
  $C_{sunk}$ is the sum of costs already invested. We analyze the behavior of two
  types of agents: naive agents that are unaware of their bias, and sophisticated
  agents that are aware of it. Since optimal (bias-free) behavior in this problem
  can involve abandoning the traversal before reaching the goal, the bias exhibited
  by these types of agents can result in sub-optimal behavior by shifting their decisions
  about abandonment. We show that in contrast to optimal agents, it is computationally
  hard to compute the optimal policy for a sophisticated agent. Our main results quantify
  the loss exhibited by these two types of agents with respect to an optimal agent.
  We present both general and topology-specific bounds.'
