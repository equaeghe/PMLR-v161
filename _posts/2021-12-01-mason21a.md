title: Nearest neighbor search under uncertainty
abstract: Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a central task in knowledge representation,
  learning, and reasoning. There is vast literature on efficient algorithms for constructing
  data structures and performing exact and approximate NNS. This paper studies NNS
  under Uncertainty (NNSU). Specifically, consider the setting in which an NNS algorithm
  has access only to a stochastic distance oracle that provides a noisy, unbiased
  estimate of the distance between any pair of points, rather than the exact distance.
  This models many situations of practical importance, including NNS based on human
  similarity judgements, physical measurements, or fast, randomized approximations
  to exact distances. A naive approach to NNSU could employ any standard NNS algorithm
  and repeatedly query and average results from the stochastic oracle (to reduce noise)
  whenever it needs a pairwise distance. The problem is that a sufficient number of
  repeated queries is unknown in advance; e.g., a point may be distant from all but
  one other point (crude distance estimates suffice) or it may be close to a large
  number of other points (accurate estimates are necessary). This paper shows how
  ideas from cover trees and multi-armed bandits can be leveraged to develop an NNSU
  algorithm that has optimal dependence on the dataset size and the (unknown) geometry
  of the dataset.
