title: 'Convergence behavior of belief propagation: estimating regions of attraction
  via Lyapunov functions'
abstract: In this work, we estimate the regions of attraction for belief propagation.
  This extends existing stability analysis and provides initial message values for
  which belief propagation is guaranteed to converge. Our approach utilizes the theory
  of Lyapunov functions that, however, does not readily yield useful regions of attraction.
  Therefore, we utilize polynomial sum-of-squares relaxations and provide an algorithm
  that computes valid Lyapunov functions. This admits a novel way of studying the
  solution space of belief propagation. Finally, we apply our approach to small-scale
  models and discuss the effect of the potentials on the regions of attraction.
