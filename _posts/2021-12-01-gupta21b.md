title: Estimating treatment effects with observed confounders and mediators
abstract: Given a causal graph, the do-calculus can express treatment effects as functionals
  of the observational joint distribution that can be estimated empirically. Sometimes
  the do-calculus identifies multiple valid formulae, prompting us to compare the
  statistical properties of the corresponding estimators. For example, the backdoor
  formula applies when all confounders are observed and the frontdoor formula applies
  when an observed mediator transmits the causal effect. In this paper, we investigate
  the over-identified scenario where both confounders and mediators are observed,
  rendering both estimators valid. Addressing the linear Gaussian causal model, we
  demonstrate that either estimator can dominate the other by an unbounded constant
  factor. Next, we derive an optimal estimator, which leverages all observed variables,
  and bound its finite-sample variance. We show that it strictly outperforms the backdoor
  and frontdoor estimators and that this improvement can be unbounded. We also present
  a procedure for combining two datasets, one with observed confounders and another
  with observed mediators. Finally, we evaluate our methods on both simulated data
  and the IHDP and JTPA datasets.
