title: 'Local explanations via necessity and sufficiency: unifying theory and practice'
abstract: Necessity and sufficiency are the building blocks of all successful explanations.
  Yet despite their importance, these notions have been conceptually underdeveloped
  and inconsistently applied in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), a fast-growing
  research area that is so far lacking in firm theoretical foundations. Building on
  work in logic, probability, and causality, we establish the central role of necessity
  and sufficiency in XAI, unifying seemingly disparate methods in a single formal
  framework. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for computing explanatory factors
  with respect to a given context, and demonstrate its flexibility and competitive
  performance against state of the art alternatives on various tasks.
