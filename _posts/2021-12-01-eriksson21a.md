title: High-dimensional Bayesian optimization with sparse axis-aligned subspaces
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for efficient optimization
  of black-box objective functions. High-dimensional BO presents a particular challenge,
  in part because the curse of dimensionality makes it difficult to define—as well
  as do inference over—a suitable class of surrogate models. We argue that Gaussian
  process surrogate models defined on sparse axis-aligned subspaces offer an attractive
  compromise between flexibility and parsimony. We demonstrate that our approach,
  which relies on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, can rapidly identify sparse
  subspaces relevant to modeling the unknown objective function, enabling sample-efficient
  high-dimensional BO. In an extensive suite of experiments comparing to existing
  methods for high-dimensional BO we demonstrate that our algorithm, Sparse Axis-Aligned
  Subspace BO (SAASBO), achieves excellent performance on several synthetic and real-world
  problems without the need to set problem-specific hyperparameters.
