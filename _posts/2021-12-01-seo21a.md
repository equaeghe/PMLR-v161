title: On the distribution of penultimate activations of classification networks
abstract: This paper studies probability distributions of penultimate activations
  of classification networks. We show that, when a classification network is trained
  with the cross-entropy loss, its final classification layer forms a Generative-Discriminative
  pair with a generative classifier based on a specific distribution of penultimate
  activations. More importantly, the distribution is parameterized by the weights
  of the final fully-connected layer, and can be considered as a generative model
  that synthesizes the penultimate activations without feeding input data. We empirically
  demonstrate that this generative model enables stable knowledge distillation in
  the presence of domain shift, and can transfer knowledge from a classifier to variational
  autoencoders and generative adversarial networks for class-conditional image generation.
