title: 'Optimized auxiliary particle filters: adapting mixture proposals via convex
  optimization'
abstract: Auxiliary particle filters (APFs) are a class of sequential Monte Carlo
  (SMC) methods for Bayesian inference in state-space models. In their original derivation,
  APFs operate in an extended state space using an auxiliary variable to improve inference.
  In this work, we propose <em>optimized auxiliary particle filters</em>, a framework
  where the traditional APF auxiliary variables are interpreted as weights in a importance
  sampling mixture proposal. Under this interpretation, we devise a mechanism for
  proposing the mixture weights that is inspired by recent advances in multiple and
  adaptive importance sampling. In particular, we propose to select the mixture weights
  by formulating a convex optimization problem, with the aim of approximating the
  filtering posterior at each timestep. Further, we propose a weighting scheme that
  generalizes previous results on the APF (Pitt et al. 2012), proving unbiasedness
  and consistency of our estimators. Our framework demonstrates significantly improved
  estimates on a range of metrics compared to state-of-the-art particle filters at
  similar computational complexity in challenging and widely used dynamical models.
