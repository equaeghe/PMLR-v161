title: Similarity measure for sparse time course data based on Gaussian processes
abstract: We propose a similarity measure for sparsely sampled time course data in
  the form of a log-likelihood ratio of Gaussian processes (GP). The proposed GP similarity
  is similar to a Bayes factor and provides enhanced robustness to noise in sparse
  time series, such as those found in various biological settings, e.g., gene transcriptomics.
  We show that the GP measure is equivalent to the Euclidean distance when the noise
  variance in the GP is negligible compared to the noise variance of the signal. Our
  numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data show improved performance
  of the GP similarity when used in conjunction with two distance-based clustering
  methods.
