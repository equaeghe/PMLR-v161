title: Deep kernels with probabilistic embeddings for small-data learning
abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are known to provide accurate predictions and uncertainty
  estimates even with small amounts of labeled data by capturing similarity between
  data points through their kernel function. However traditional GP kernels are not
  very effective at capturing similarity between high dimensional data points. Neural
  networks can be used to learn good representations that encode intricate structures
  in high dimensional data, and can be used as inputs to the GP kernel. However the
  huge data requirement of neural networks makes this approach ineffective in small
  data settings. To solves the conflicting problems of representation learning and
  data efficiency, we propose to learn deep kernels on probabilistic embeddings by
  using a probabilistic neural network. Our approach maps high-dimensional data to
  a probability distribution in a low dimensional subspace and then computes a kernel
  between these distributions to capture similarity. To enable end-to-end learning,
  we derive a functional gradient descent procedure for training the model. Experiments
  on a variety of datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
  in GP kernel learning in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. We also extend
  our approach to other small-data paradigms such as few-shot classification where
  it outperforms previous approaches on mini-Imagenet and CUB datasets.
