title: 'Global explanations with decision rules: a co-learning approach'
abstract: Black-box machine learning models can be extremely accurate. Yet, in critical
  applications such as in healthcare or justice, if models cannot be explained, domain
  experts will be reluctant to use them. A common way to explain a black-box model
  is to approximate it by a simpler model such as a decision tree. In this paper,
  we propose a co-learning framework to learn decision rules as explanations of black-box
  models through knowledge distillation and simultaneously constrain the black-box
  model by these explanations; all of this in a differentiable manner. To do so, we
  introduce the soft truncated Gaussian mixture analysis (STruGMA), a probabilistic
  model which encapsulates hyper-rectangle decision rules. With STruGMA, global explanations
  can be extracted by any rule learner such as decision lists, sets or trees. We provide
  evidences through experiments that our framework can globally explain differentiable
  black-box models such as neural networks. In particular, the explanation fidelity
  is increased, while the accuracy of the models is marginally impacted.
