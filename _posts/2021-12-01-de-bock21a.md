title: Sum-product laws and efficient algorithms for imprecise Markov chains
abstract: We propose two sum-product laws for imprecise Markov chains, and use these
  laws to derive two algorithms to efficiently compute lower and upper expectations
  for imprecise Markov chains under complete independence and epistemic irrelevance.
  These algorithms work for inferences that have a corresponding sum-product decomposition,
  and we argue that many well-known inferences fit their scope. We illustrate our
  results on a simple epidemiological example.
