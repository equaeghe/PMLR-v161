title: Leveraging probabilistic circuits for nonparametric multi-output regression
abstract: Inspired by recent advances in the field of expert-based approximations
  of Gaussian processes (GPs), we present an expert-based approach to large-scale
  multi-output regression using single-output GP experts. Employing a deeply structured
  mixture of single-output GPs encoded via a probabilistic circuit allows us to capture
  correlations between multiple output dimensions accurately. By recursively partitioning
  the covariate space and the output space, posterior inference in our model reduces
  to inference on single-output GP experts, which only need to be conditioned on a
  small subset of the observations. We show that inference can be performed exactly
  and efficiently in our model, that it can capture correlations between output dimensions
  and, hence, often outperforms approaches that do not incorporate inter-output correlations,
  as demonstrated on several data sets in terms of the negative log predictive density.
