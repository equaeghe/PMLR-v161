title: Towards a unified framework for fair and stable graph representation learning
abstract: As the representations output by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly
  employed in real-world applications, it becomes important to ensure that these representations
  are fair and stable. In this work, we establish a key connection between counterfactual
  fairness and stability and leverage it to propose a novel framework, NIFTY (uNIfying
  Fairness and stabiliTY), which can be used with any GNN to learn fair and stable
  representations. We introduce a novel objective function that simultaneously accounts
  for fairness and stability and develop a layer-wise weight normalization using the
  Lipschitz constant to enhance neural message passing in GNNs. In doing so, we enforce
  fairness and stability both in the objective function as well as in the GNN architecture.
  Further, we show theoretically that our layer-wise weight normalization promotes
  counterfactual fairness and stability in the resulting representations. We introduce
  three new graph datasets comprising of high-stakes decisions in criminal justice
  and financial lending domains. Extensive experimentation with the above datasets
  demonstrates the efficacy of our framework.
