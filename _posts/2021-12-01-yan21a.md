title: Explaining fast improvement in online imitation learning
abstract: 'Online imitation learning (IL) is an algorithmic framework that leverages
  interactions with expert policies for efficient policy optimization. Here policies
  are optimized by performing online learning on a sequence of loss functions that
  encourage the learner to mimic expert actions, and if the online learning has no
  regret, the agent can provably learn an expert-like policy. Online IL has demonstrated
  empirical successes in many applications and interestingly, its policy improvement
  speed observed in practice is usually much faster than existing theory suggests.
  In this work, we provide an explanation of this phenomenon. Let $\xi$ denote the
  policy class bias and assume the online IL loss functions are convex, smooth, and
  non-negative. We prove that, after $N$ rounds of online IL with stochastic feedback,
  the policy improves in $\tilde{O}(1/N + \sqrt{\xi/N})$ in both expectation and high
  probability. In other words, we show that adopting a sufficiently expressive policy
  class in online IL has two benefits: both the policy improvement speed increases
  and the performance bias decreases.'
