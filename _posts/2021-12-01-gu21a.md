title: 'Staying in shape: learning invariant shape representations using contrastive
  learning'
abstract: Creating representations of shapes that are invariant to isometric or almost-isometric
  transformations has long been an area of interest in shape analysis, since enforcing
  invariance allows the learning of more effective and robust shape representations.
  Most existing invariant shape representations are handcrafted, and previous work
  on learning shape representations do not focus on producing invariant representations.
  To solve the problem of learning unsupervised invariant shape representations, we
  use contrastive learning, which produces discriminative representations through
  learning invariance to user-specified data augmentations. To produce representations
  that are specifically isometry and almost-isometry invariant, we propose new data
  augmentations that randomly sample these transformations. We show experimentally
  that our method outperforms previous unsupervised learning approaches in both effectiveness
  and robustness.
