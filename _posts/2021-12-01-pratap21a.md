title: Variance reduction in frequency estimators via control variates method
abstract: Generating succinct summaries (also known as <em>sketches</em>) of massive
  data streams is becoming increasingly important. Such a task typically requires
  fast, accurate, and small space algorithms in order to support the downstream applications,
  mainly in areas such as data analysis, machine learning and data mining. A fundamental
  and well-studied problem in this context is that of estimating the frequencies of
  the items appearing in a data stream. The Count-Min-Sketch (Cormode and Muthukrishnan,
  J. Algorithms, 55(1):58–75, 2005) and Count-Sketch (Charikar et al., Theor. Comput.
  Sci., 312(1):3–15, 2004) are two known classical algorithms for this purpose. However,
  a limitation of these techniques is that the variance of their estimate tends to
  be large. In this work, we address this problem and suggest a technique that reduces
  the variance in their respective estimates, at the cost of little computational
  overhead. Our technique relies on the classical Control-Variate trick (Lavenberg
  and Welch, Manage. Sci., 27:322–335, 1981) used for reducing variance in Monte-Carlo
  simulation. We present a theoretical analysis of our proposal by carefully choosing
  the control variates and complement them with experiments on synthetic as well as
  real-world datasets.
