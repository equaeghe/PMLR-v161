title: 'CLAIM: curriculum learning policy for influence maximization in unknown social
  networks'
abstract: Influence maximization is the problem of finding a small subset of nodes
  in a network that can maximize the diffusion of information. Recently, it has also
  found application in HIV prevention, substance abuse prevention, micro-finance adoption,
  etc., where the goal is to identify the set of peer leaders in a real-world physical
  social network who can disseminate information to a large group of people. Unlike
  online social networks, real-world networks are not completely known, and collecting
  information about the network is costly as it involves surveying multiple people.
  In this paper, we focus on this problem of network discovery for influence maximization.
  The existing work in this direction proposes a reinforcement learning framework.
  As the environment interactions in real-world settings are costly, so it is important
  for the reinforcement learning algorithms to have minimum possible environment interactions,
  i.e, to be sample efficient. In this work, we propose CLAIM - Curriculum LeArning
  Policy for Influence Maximization to improve the sample efficiency of RL methods.
  We conduct experiments on real-world datasets and show that our approach can outperform
  the current best approach.
