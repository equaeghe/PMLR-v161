title: Variational refinement for importance sampling using the forward Kullback-Leibler
  divergence
abstract: Variational Inference (VI) is a popular alternative to asymptotically exact
  sampling in Bayesian inference. Its main workhorse is optimization over a reverse
  Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL), which typically underestimates the tail of the
  posterior leading to miscalibration and potential degeneracy. Importance sampling
  (IS), on the other hand, is often used to fine-tune and de-bias the estimates of
  approximate Bayesian inference procedures. The quality of IS crucially depends on
  the choice of the proposal distribution. Ideally, the proposal distribution has
  heavier tails than the target, which is rarely achievable by minimizing the RKL.
  We thus propose a novel combination of optimization and sampling techniques for
  approximate Bayesian inference by constructing an IS proposal distribution through
  the minimization of a forward KL (FKL) divergence. This approach guarantees asymptotic
  consistency and a fast convergence towards both the optimal IS estimator and the
  optimal variational approximation. We empirically demonstrate on real data that
  our method is competitive with variational boosting and MCMC.
