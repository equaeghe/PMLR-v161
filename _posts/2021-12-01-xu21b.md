title: 'Simple combinatorial algorithms for combinatorial bandits: corruptions and
  approximations'
abstract: We consider the stochastic combinatorial semi-bandit problem with adversarial
  corruptions. We provide a simple combinatorial algorithm that can achieve a regret
  of $\tilde{O}\left(C+d^2K/\Delta_{min}\right)$ where $C$ is the total amount of
  corruptions, $d$ is the maximal number of arms one can play in each round, $K$ is
  the number of arms. If one selects only one arm in each round, we achieves a regret
  of $\tilde{O}\left(C+\sum_{\Delta_i>0}(1/\Delta_i)\right)$. Our algorithm is combinatorial
  and improves on the previous combinatorial algorithm by [Gupta et al., COLT2019]
  (their bound is $\tilde{O}\left(KC+\sum_{\Delta_i>0}(1/\Delta_i)\right)$), and almost
  matches the best known bounds obtained by [Zimmert et al., ICML2019] and [Zimmert
  and Seldin, AISTATS2019] (up to logarithmic factor). Note that the algorithms in
  [Zimmert et al., ICML2019] and [Zimmert and Seldin, AISTATS2019] require one to
  solve complex convex programs while our algorithm is combinatorial, very easy to
  implement, requires weaker assumptions and has very low oracle complexity and running
  time. We also study the setting where we only get access to an approximation oracle
  for the stochastic combinatorial semi-bandit problem. Our algorithm achieves an
  (approximation) regret bound of $\tilde{O}\left(d\sqrt{KT}\right)$. Our algorithm
  is very simple, only worse than the best known regret bound by $\sqrt{d}$, and has
  much lower oracle complexity than previous work.
