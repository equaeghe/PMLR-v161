title: Maximal ancestral graph structure learning via exact search
abstract: Generalizing Bayesian networks, maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) are a theoretically
  appealing model class for dealing with unobserved variables. Despite significant
  advances in developing practical exact algorithms for learning score-optimal Bayesian
  networks, practical exact algorithms for learning score-optimal MAGs have not been
  developed to-date. We develop here methodology for score-based structure learning
  of directed maximal ancestral graphs. In particular, we develop local score computation
  employing a linear Gaussian BIC score, as well as score pruning techniques, which
  are essential for exact structure learning approaches. Furthermore, employing dynamic
  programming and branch and bound, we present a first exact search algorithm that
  is guaranteed to find a globally optimal MAG for given local scores. The experiments
  show that our approach is able to find considerably higher scoring MAGs than previously
  proposed in-exact approaches.
