title: Bandits with partially observable confounded data
abstract: We study linear contextual bandits with access to a large, confounded, offline
  dataset that was sampled from some fixed policy. We show that this problem is closely
  related to a variant of the bandit problem with side information. We construct a
  linear bandit algorithm that takes advantage of the projected information, and prove
  regret bounds. Our results demonstrate the ability to take advantage of confounded
  offline data. Particularly, we prove regret bounds that improve current bounds by
  a factor related to the visible dimensionality of the contexts in the data. Our
  results indicate that confounded offline data can significantly improve online learning
  algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate various characteristics of our approach through
  synthetic simulations.
