title: Statistically robust neural network classification
abstract: 'Despite their numerous successes, there are many scenarios where adversarial
  risk metrics do not provide an appropriate measure of robustness. For example, test-time
  perturbations may occur in a probabilistic manner rather than being generated by
  an explicit adversary, while the poor trainâ€“test generalization of adversarial metrics
  can limit their usage to simple problems. Motivated by this, we develop a probabilistic
  robust risk framework, the statistically robust risk (SRR), which considers pointwise
  corruption distributions, as opposed to worst-case adversaries. The SRR provides
  a distinct and complementary measure of robust performance, compared to natural
  and adversarial risk. We show that the SRR admits estimation and training schemes
  which are as simple and efficient as for the natural risk: these simply require
  noising the inputs, but with a principled derivation for exactly how and why this
  should be done. Furthermore, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally
  that it can provide superior generalization performance compared with adversarial
  risks, enabling application to high-dimensional datasets.'
