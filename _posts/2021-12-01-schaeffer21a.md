title: Efficient online inference for nonparametric mixture models
abstract: 'Natural data are often well-described as belonging to latent clusters.
  When the number of clusters is unknown, Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models can
  provide a flexible and powerful technique to model the data. However, algorithms
  for inference in nonparametric mixture models fail to meet two critical requirements
  for practical use: (1) that inference can be performed online, and (2) that inference
  is efficient in the large time/sample limit. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian
  recursion to efficiently infer a posterior distribution over discrete latent variables
  from a sequence of observations in an online manner, assuming a Chinese Restaurant
  Process prior on the sequence of latent variables. Our recursive filter, which we
  call the Recursive Chinese Restaurant Process (R-CRP), has quasilinear average time
  complexity and logarithmic average space complexity in the total number of observations.
  We experimentally compare our filtering method against both online and offline inference
  algorithms including Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational approximations and DP-Means,
  and demonstrate that our inference algorithm achieves comparable or better performance
  for a fraction of the runtime.'
