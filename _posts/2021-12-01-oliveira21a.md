title: No-regret approximate inference via Bayesian optimisation
abstract: We consider Bayesian inference problems where the likelihood function is
  either expensive to evaluate or only available via noisy estimates. This setting
  encompasses application scenarios involving, for example, large datasets or models
  whose likelihood evaluations require expensive simulations. We formulate this problem
  within a Bayesian optimisation framework over a space of probability distributions
  and derive an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm to propose non-parametric distribution
  candidates. The algorithm is designed to minimise regret, which is defined as the
  Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the true posterior in this case. Equipped
  with a Gaussian process surrogate model, we show that the resulting UCB algorithm
  achieves asymptotically no regret. The method can be easily implemented as a batch
  Bayesian optimisation algorithm whose point evaluations are selected via Markov
  chain Monte Carlo. Experimental results demonstrate the methodâ€™s performance on
  inference problems.
