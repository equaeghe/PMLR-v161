title: Communication efficient parallel reinforcement learning
abstract: We consider the problem where $M$ agents interact with $M$ identical and
  independent environments with $S$ states and $A$ actions using reinforcement learning
  for $T$ rounds. The agents share their data with a central server to minimize their
  regret. We aim to find an algorithm that allows the agents to minimize the regret
  with infrequent communication rounds. We provide dist-UCRL which runs at each agent
  and prove that the total cumulative regret of $M$ agents is upper bounded as $\Tilde{O}(DS\sqrt{MAT})$
  for a Markov Decision Process with diameter $D$, number of states $S$, and number
  of actions $A$. The agents synchronize after their visitations to any state-action
  pair exceeds a certain threshold. Using this, we obtain a bound of $O\left(MSA\log(MT)\right)$
  on the total number of communications rounds. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm
  against multiple environments and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs
  at par with an always communication version of the UCRL2 algorithm, while with significantly
  lower communication.
