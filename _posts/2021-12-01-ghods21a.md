title: Decentralized multi-agent active search for sparse signals
abstract: Active search refers to the problem of efficiently locating targets in an
  unknown environment by actively making data-collection decisions. In this paper,
  we are focusing on multiple aerial robots (agents) detecting targets such as gas
  leaks, radiation sources or human survivors of disasters. One of the main challenges
  of active search with multiple agents in unknown environments is impracticality
  of central coordination due to the difficulties of connectivity maintenance. In
  this paper, we propose two distinct active search algorithms that allow for multiple
  robots to independently make data-collection decisions without a central coordinator.
  Throughout we consider that targets are sparsely located around the environment
  in keeping with compressive sensing assumptions and its applicability in real world
  scenarios. Additionally, while most common sensing algorithms assume that agents
  can sense the entire environment (e.g. compressive sensing) or sense point-wise
  (e.g. Bayesian Optimization) at a time, we make a realistic assumption that each
  agent can only sense a contiguous region of space at each time step. We provide
  simulation results as well as theoretical analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of
  our proposed algorithms.
