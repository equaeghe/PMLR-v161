title: Confidence in causal discovery with linear causal models
abstract: 'Structural causal models postulate noisy functional relations among a set
  of interacting variables. The causal structure underlying each such model is naturally
  represented by a directed graph whose edges indicate for each variable which other
  variables it causally depends upon. Under a number of different model assumptions,
  it has been shown that this causal graph and, thus also, causal effects are identifiable
  from mere observational data. For these models, practical algorithms have been devised
  to learn the graph. Moreover, when the graph is known, standard techniques may be
  used to give estimates and confidence intervals for causal effects. We argue, however,
  that a two-step method that first learns a graph and then treats the graph as known
  yields confidence intervals that are overly optimistic and can drastically fail
  to account for the uncertain causal structure. To address this issue we lay out
  a framework based on test inversion that allows us to give confidence regions for
  total causal effects that capture both sources of uncertainty: causal structure
  and numerical size of nonzero effects. Our ideas are developed in the context of
  bivariate linear causal models with homoscedastic errors, but as we exemplify they
  are generalizable to larger systems as well as other settings such as, in particular,
  linear non-Gaussian models.'
