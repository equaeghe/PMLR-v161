title: Neural markov logic networks
abstract: We introduce neural Markov logic networks (NMLNs), a statistical relational
  learning system that borrows ideas from Markov logic. Like Markov logic networks
  (MLNs), NMLNs are an exponential-family model for modelling distributions over possible
  worlds, but unlike MLNs, they do not rely on explicitly specified first-order logic
  rules. Instead, NMLNs learn an implicit representation of such rules as a neural
  network that acts as a potential function on fragments of the relational structure.
  Similarly to many neural symbolic methods, NMLNs can exploit embeddings of constants
  but, unlike them, NMLNs work well also in their absence. This is extremely important
  for predicting in settings other than the transductive one. We showcase the potential
  of NMLNs on knowledge-base completion, triple classification and on generation of
  molecular (graph) data.
