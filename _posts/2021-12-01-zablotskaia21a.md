title: 'PROVIDE: a probabilistic framework for unsupervised video decomposition'
abstract: Unsupervised multi-object scene decomposition is a fast-emerging problem
  in representation learning. Despite significant progress in static scenes, such
  models are unable to leverage important dynamic cues present in videos. We propose
  PROVIDE, a novel unsupervised framework for PRObabilistic VIdeo DEcomposition based
  on a temporal extension of iterative inference. PROVIDE is powerful enough to jointly
  model complex individual multi-object representations and explicit temporal dependencies
  between latent variables across frames. This is achieved by leveraging 2D-LSTM,
  temporally conditioned inference and generation within the iterative amortized inference
  for posterior refinement. Our method improves the overall quality of decompositions,
  encodes information about the objectsâ€™ dynamics, and can be used to predict trajectories
  of each object separately. Additionally, we show that our model has a high accuracy
  even without color information. We demonstrate the decomposition capabilities of
  our model and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art on several benchmark
  datasets, one of which was curated for this work and will be made publicly available.
