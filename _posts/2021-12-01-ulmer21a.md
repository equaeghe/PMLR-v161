title: 'Know your limits: Uncertainty estimation with ReLU classifiers fails at reliable
  OOD detection'
abstract: A crucial requirement for reliable deployment of deep learning models for
  safety-critical applications is the ability to identify out-of-distribution (OOD)
  data points, samples which differ from the training data and on which a model might
  underperform. Previous work has attempted to tackle this problem using uncertainty
  estimation techniques. However, there is empirical evidence that a large family
  of these techniques do not detect OOD reliably in classification tasks. This paper
  gives a theoretical explanation for said experimental findings and illustrates it
  on synthetic data. We prove that such techniques are not able to reliably identify
  OOD samples in a classification setting, since their level of confidence is generalized
  to unseen areas of the feature space. This result stems from the interplay between
  the representation of ReLU networks as piece-wise affine transformations, the saturating
  nature of activation functions like softmax, and the most widely-used uncertainty
  metrics.
