title: Variational inference with continuously-indexed normalizing flows
abstract: Continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) have recently achieved improvements over
  baseline normalizing flows on a variety of density estimation tasks. CIFs do not
  possess a closed-form marginal density, and so, unlike standard flows, cannot be
  plugged in directly to a variational inference (VI) scheme in order to produce a
  more expressive family of approximate posteriors. However, we show here how CIFs
  can be used as part of an auxiliary VI scheme to formulate and train expressive
  posterior approximations in a natural way. We exploit the conditional independence
  structure of multi-layer CIFs to build the required auxiliary inference models,
  which we show empirically yield low-variance estimators of the model evidence. We
  then demonstrate the advantages of CIFs over baseline flows in VI problems when
  the posterior distribution of interest possesses a complicated topology, obtaining
  improved results in both the Bayesian inference and surrogate maximum likelihood
  settings.
