title: Robust reinforcement learning under minimax regret for green security
abstract: Green security domains feature defenders who plan patrols in the face of
  uncertainty about the adversarial behavior of poachers, illegal loggers, and illegal
  fishers. Importantly, the deterrence effect of patrols on adversaries’ future behavior
  makes patrol planning a sequential decision-making problem. Therefore, we focus
  on robust sequential patrol planning for green security following the minimax regret
  criterion, which has not been considered in the literature. We formulate the problem
  as a game between the defender and nature who controls the parameter values of the
  adversarial behavior and design an algorithm MIRROR to find a robust policy. MIRROR
  uses two reinforcement learning–based oracles and solves a restricted game considering
  limited defender strategies and parameter values. We evaluate MIRROR on real-world
  poaching data.
