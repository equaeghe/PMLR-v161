title: Graph reparameterizations for enabling 1000+ Monte Carlo iterations in Bayesian
  deep neural networks
abstract: 'Uncertainty estimation in deep models is essential in many real-world applications
  and has benefited from developments over the last several years. Recent evidence
  suggests that existing solutions dependent on simple Gaussian formulations may not
  be sufficient. However, moving to other distributions necessitates Monte Carlo (MC)
  sampling to estimate quantities such as the KL divergence: it could be expensive
  and scales poorly as the dimensions of both the input data and the model grow. This
  is directly related to the structure of the computation graph, which can grow linearly
  as a function of the number of MC samples needed. Here, we construct a framework
  to describe these computation graphs, and identify probability families where the
  graph size can be independent or only weakly dependent on the number of MC samples.
  These families correspond directly to large classes of distributions. Empirically,
  we can run a much larger number of iterations for MC approximations for larger architectures
  used in computer vision with gains in performance measured in confident accuracy,
  stability of training, memory and training time.'
