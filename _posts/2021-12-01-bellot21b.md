title: A kernel two-sample test with selection bias
abstract: Hypothesis testing can help decision-making by quantifying distributional
  differences between two populations from observational data. However, these tests
  may inherit biases embedded in the data collection mechanism (some instances often
  being systematically more likely included in our sample) and consistently reproduce
  biased decisions. We propose a two-sample test that adjusts for selection bias by
  accounting for differences in marginal distributions of confounding variables. Our
  test statistic is a weighted distance between samples embedded in a reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space, whose balancing weights provably correct for bias. We establish
  the asymptotic distributions under null and alternative hypotheses, and prove the
  consistency of empirical approximations to the underlying population quantity. We
  conclude with performance evaluations on artificial data and experiments on treatment
  effect studies from economics.
