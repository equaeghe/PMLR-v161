title: Contextual policy transfer in reinforcement learning domains via deep mixtures-of-experts
abstract: In reinforcement learning, agents that consider the context or current state
  when transferring source policies have been shown to outperform context-free approaches.
  However, existing approaches suffer from limitations, including sensitivity to sparse
  or delayed rewards and estimation errors in values. One important insight is that
  explicit learned models of the source dynamics, when available, could benefit contextual
  transfer in such settings. In this paper, we assume a family of tasks with shared
  sub-goals but different dynamics, and availability of estimated dynamics and policies
  for source tasks. To deal with possible estimation errors in dynamics, we introduce
  a novel Bayesian mixture-of-experts for learning state-dependent beliefs over source
  task dynamics that match the target dynamics using state transitions collected from
  the target task. The mixture is easy to interpret, is robust to estimation errors
  in dynamics, and is compatible with most RL algorithms. We incorporate it into standard
  policy reuse frameworks and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from OpenAI
  gym.
