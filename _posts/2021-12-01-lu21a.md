title: Variance-dependent best arm identification
abstract: We study the problem of identifying the best arm in a stochastic multi-armed
  bandit game. Given a set of $n$ arms indexed from $1$ to $n$, each arm $i$ is associated
  with an unknown reward distribution supported on $[0,1]$ with mean $\theta_i$ and
  variance $\sigma_i^2$. Assume $\theta_1 > \theta_2 \geq \cdots \geq\theta_n$. We
  propose an adaptive algorithm which explores the gaps and variances of the rewards
  of the arms and makes future decisions based on the gathered information using a
  novel approach called <em>grouped median elimination</em>. The proposed algorithm
  guarantees to output the best arm with probability $(1-\delta)$ and uses at most
  $O \left(\sum_{i = 1}^n \left(\frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta_i}\right)(\ln
  \delta^{-1} + \ln \ln \Delta_i^{-1})\right)$ samples, where $\Delta_i$ ($i \geq
  2$) denotes the reward gap between arm $i$ and the best arm and we define $\Delta_1
  = \Delta_2$. This achieves a significant advantage over the variance-independent
  algorithms in some favorable scenarios and is the first result that removes the
  extra $\ln n$ factor on the best arm compared with the state-of-the-art. We further
  show that $\Omega \left( \sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta_i}
  \right) \ln \delta^{-1} \right)$ samples are necessary for an algorithm to achieve
  the same goal, thereby illustrating that our algorithm is optimal up to doubly logarithmic
  terms.
