title: 'Trumpets: Injective flows for inference and inverse problems'
abstract: We propose injective generative models called Trumpets that generalize invertible
  normalizing flows. The proposed generators progressively increase dimension from
  a low-dimensional latent space. We demonstrate that Trumpets can be trained orders
  of magnitudes faster than standard flows while yielding samples of comparable or
  better quality. They retain many of the advantages of the standard flows such as
  training based on maximum likelihood and a fast, exact inverse of the generator.
  Since Trumpets are injective and have fast inverses, they can be effectively used
  for downstream Bayesian inference. To wit, we use Trumpet priors for maximum a posteriori
  estimation in the context of image reconstruction from compressive measurements,
  outperforming competitive baselines in terms of reconstruction quality and speed.
  We then propose an efficient method for posterior characterization and uncertainty
  quantification with Trumpets by taking advantage of the low-dimensional latent space
