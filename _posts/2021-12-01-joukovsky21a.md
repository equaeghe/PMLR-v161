title: Generalization error bounds for deep unfolding RNNs
abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful models with the ability to
  model sequential data. However, they are often viewed as black-boxes and lack in
  interpretability. Deep unfolding methods take a step towards interpretability by
  designing deep neural networks as learned variations of iterative optimization algorithms
  to solve various signal processing tasks. In this paper, we explore theoretical
  aspects of deep unfolding RNNs in terms of their generalization ability. Specifically,
  we derive generalization error bounds for a class of deep unfolding RNNs via Rademacher
  complexity analysis. To our knowledge, these are the first generalization bounds
  proposed for deep unfolding RNNs. We show theoretically that our bounds are tighter
  than similar ones for other recent RNNs, in terms of the number of timesteps. By
  training models in a classification setting, we demonstrate that deep unfolding
  RNNs can outperform traditional RNNs in standard sequence classification tasks.
  These experiments allow us to relate the empirical generalization error to the theoretical
  bounds. In particular, we show that over-parametrized deep unfolding models like
  reweighted-RNN achieve tight theoretical error bounds with minimal decrease in accuracy,
  when trained with explicit regularization.
