title: Addressing fairness in classification with a model-agnostic multi-objective
  algorithm
abstract: The goal of fairness in classification is to learn a classifier that does
  not discriminate against groups of individuals based on sensitive attributes, such
  as race and gender. One approach to designing fair algorithms is to use relaxations
  of fairness notions as regularization terms or in a constrained optimization problem.
  We observe that the hyperbolic tangent function can approximate the indicator function.
  We leverage this property to define a differentiable relaxation that approximates
  fairness notions provably better than existing relaxations. In addition, we propose
  a model-agnostic multi-objective architecture that can simultaneously optimize for
  multiple fairness notions and multiple sensitive attributes and supports all statistical
  parity-based notions of fairness. We use our relaxation with the multi-objective
  architecture to learn fair classifiers. Experiments on public datasets show that
  our method suffers a significantly lower loss of accuracy than current debiasing
  algorithms relative to the unconstrained model.
