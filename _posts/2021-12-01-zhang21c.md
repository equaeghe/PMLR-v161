title: The complexity of nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization
abstract: This paper studies the complexity for finding approximate stationary points
  of nonconvex-strongly-concave (NC-SC) smooth minimax problems, in both general and
  averaged smooth finite-sum settings. We establish nontrivial lower complexity bounds
  for the two settings, respectively. Our result reveals substantial gaps between
  these limits and best-known upper bounds in the literature. To close these gaps,
  we introduce a generic acceleration scheme that deploys existing gradient-based
  methods to solve a sequence of crafted strongly-convex-strongly-concave subproblems.
  In the general setting, the complexity of our proposed algorithm nearly matches
  the lower bound; in particular, it removes an additional poly-logarithmic dependence
  on accuracy present in previous works. In the averaged smooth finite-sum setting,
  our proposed algorithm improves over previous algorithms by providing a nearly-tight
  dependence on the condition number.
