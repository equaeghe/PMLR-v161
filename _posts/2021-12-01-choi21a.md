title: Featurized density ratio estimation
abstract: Density ratio estimation serves as an important technique in the unsupervised
  machine learning toolbox. However, such ratios are difficult to estimate for complex,
  high-dimensional data, particularly when the densities of interest are sufficiently
  different. In our work, we propose to leverage an invertible generative model to
  map the two distributions into a common feature space prior to estimation. This
  featurization brings the densities closer together in latent space, sidestepping
  pathological scenarios where the learned density ratios in input space can be arbitrarily
  inaccurate. At the same time, the invertibility of our feature map guarantees that
  the ratios computed in feature space are equivalent to those in input space. Empirically,
  we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a variety of downstream tasks that
  require access to accurate density ratios such as mutual information estimation,
  targeted sampling in deep generative models, and classification with data augmentation.
