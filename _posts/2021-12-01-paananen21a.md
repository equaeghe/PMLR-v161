title: Uncertainty-aware sensitivity analysis using Rényi divergences
abstract: For nonlinear supervised learning models, assessing the importance of predictor
  variables or their interactions is not straightforward because importance can vary
  in the domain of the variables. Importance can be assessed locally with sensitivity
  analysis using general methods that rely on the model’s predictions or their derivatives.
  In this work, we extend derivative based sensitivity analysis to a Bayesian setting
  by differentiating the R\’{e}nyi divergence of a model’s predictive distribution.
  By utilising the predictive distribution instead of a point prediction, the model
  uncertainty is taken into account in a principled way. Our empirical results on
  simulated and real data sets demonstrate accurate and reliable identification of
  important variables and interaction effects compared to alternative methods.
