title: Strategically efficient exploration in competitive multi-agent reinforcement
  learning
abstract: High sample complexity remains a barrier to the application of reinforcement
  learning (RL), particularly in multi-agent systems. A large body of work has demonstrated
  that exploration mechanisms based on the principle of optimism under uncertainty
  can significantly improve the sample efficiency of RL in single agent tasks. This
  work seeks to understand the role of optimistic exploration in non-cooperative multi-agent
  settings. We will show that, in zero-sum games, optimistic exploration can cause
  the learner to waste time sampling parts of the state space that are irrelevant
  to strategic play, as they can only be reached through cooperation between both
  players. To address this issue, we introduce a formal notion of strategically efficient
  exploration in Markov games, and use this to develop two strategically efficient
  learning algorithms for finite Markov games. We demonstrate that these methods can
  be significantly more sample efficient than their optimistic counterparts.
