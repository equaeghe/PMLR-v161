title: Contrastive prototype learning with augmented embeddings for few-shot learning
abstract: Most recent few-shot learning (FSL) methods are based on meta-learning with
  episodic training. In each meta-training episode, a discriminative feature embedding
  and/or classifier are first constructed from a support set in an inner loop, and
  then evaluated in an outer loop using a query set for model updating. This query
  set sample centered learning objective is however intrinsically limited in addressing
  the lack of training data problem in the support set. In this paper, a novel contrastive
  prototype learning with augmented embeddings (CPLAE) model is proposed to overcome
  this limitation. First, data augmentations are introduced to both the support and
  query sets with each sample now being represented as an augmented embedding (AE)
  composed of concatenated embeddings of both the original and augmented versions.
  Second, a novel support set class prototype centered contrastive loss is proposed
  for contrastive prototype learning (CPL). With a class prototype as an anchor, CPL
  aims to pull the query samples of the same class closer and those of different classes
  further away. This support set sample centered loss is highly complementary to the
  existing query centered loss, fully exploiting the limited training data in each
  episode. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed
  CPLAE achieves new state-of-the-art.
