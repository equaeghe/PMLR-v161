title: On the effects of quantisation on model uncertainty in Bayesian neural networks
abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are making significant progress in many
  research areas where decision-making needs to be accompanied by uncertainty estimation.
  Being able to quantify uncertainty while making decisions is essential for understanding
  when the model is over-/under-confident, and hence BNNs are attracting interest
  in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and robotics.
  Nevertheless, BNNs have not been as widely used in industrial practice, mainly because
  of their increased memory and compute costs. In this work, we investigate quantisation
  of BNNs by compressing 32-bit floating-point weights and activations to their integer
  counterparts, that has already been successful in reducing the compute demand in
  standard pointwise neural networks. We study three types of quantised BNNs, we evaluate
  them under a wide range of different settings, and we empirically demonstrate that
  a uniform quantisation scheme applied to BNNs does not substantially decrease their
  quality of uncertainty estimation.
