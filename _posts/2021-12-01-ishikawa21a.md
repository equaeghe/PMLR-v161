title: Efficient debiased evidence estimation by multilevel Monte Carlo sampling
abstract: In this paper, we propose a new stochastic optimization algorithm for Bayesian
  inference based on multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods. In Bayesian statistics,
  biased estimators of the model evidence have been often used as stochastic objectives
  because the existing debiasing techniques are computationally costly to apply. To
  overcome this issue, we apply an MLMC sampling technique to construct low-variance
  unbiased estimators both for the model evidence and its gradient. In the theoretical
  analysis, we show that the computational cost required for our proposed MLMC estimator
  to estimate the model evidence or its gradient with a given accuracy is an order
  of magnitude smaller than those of the previously known estimators. Our numerical
  experiments confirm considerable computational savings compared to the conventional
  estimators. Combining our MLMC estimator with gradient-based stochastic optimization
  results in a new scalable, efficient, debiased inference algorithm for Bayesian
  statistical models.
