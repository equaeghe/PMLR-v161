title: An unsupervised video game playstyle metric via state discretization
abstract: On playing video games, different players usually have their own playstyles.
  Recently, there have been great improvements for the video game AIs on the playing
  strength. However, past researches for analyzing the behaviors of players still
  used heuristic rules or the behavior features with the game-environment support,
  thus being exhausted for the developers to define the features of discriminating
  various playstyles. In this paper, we propose the first metric for video game playstyles
  directly from the game observations and actions, without any prior specification
  on the playstyle in the target game. Our proposed method is built upon a novel scheme
  of learning discrete representations that can map game observations into latent
  discrete states, such that playstyles can be exhibited from these discrete states.
  Namely, we measure the playstyle distance based on game observations aligned to
  the same states. We demonstrate high playstyle accuracy of our metric in experiments
  on some video game platforms, including TORCS, RGSK, and seven Atari games, and
  for different agents including rule-based AI bots, learning-based AI bots, and human
  players.
