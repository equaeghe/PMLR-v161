title: Entropic Inequality Constraints from e-separation Relations in Directed Acyclic
  Graphs with Hidden Variables
abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with hidde variables are often used to characterize
  causal relations between variables in a system. When some variables are unobserved,
  DAGs imply a notoriously complicated set of constraints on the distribution of observed
  variables. In this work, we present entropic inequality constraints that are implied
  by e-separation relations in hidden variable DAGs with discrete observed variables.
  The constraints can intuitively be understood to follow from the fact that the capacity
  of variables along a causal pathway to convey information is restricted by their
  entropy; e.g. at the extreme case, a variable with entropy 0 can convey no information.
  We show how these constraints can be used to learn about the true causal model from
  an observed data distribution. In addition, we propose a measure of causal influence
  called the minimal mediary entropy, and demonstrate that it can concisely augment
  traditional measures such as the average treatment effect.
