title: Unsupervised anomaly detection with adversarial mirrored autoencoders
abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is of paramount importance in
  all Machine Learning applications. Deep generative modeling has emerged as a dominant
  paradigm to model complex data distributions without labels. However, prior work
  has shown that generative models tend to assign higher likelihoods to OOD samples
  compared to the data distribution on which they were trained. First, we propose
  Adversarial Mirrored Autoencoder (AMA), a variant of Adversarial Autoencoder, which
  uses a mirrored Wasserstein loss in the discriminator to enforce better semantic-level
  reconstruction. We also propose a latent space regularization to learn a compact
  manifold for in-distribution samples. The use of AMA produces better feature representations
  that improve anomaly detection performance. Second, we put forward an alternative
  measure of anomaly score to replace the reconstruction-based metric which has been
  traditionally used in generative model-based anomaly detection methods. Our method
  outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection on several
  OOD detection benchmarks.
