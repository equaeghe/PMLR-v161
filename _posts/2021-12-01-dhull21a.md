title: A heuristic for statistical seriation
abstract: We study the statistical seriation problem, where the goal is to estimate
  a matrix whose rows satisfy the same shape constraint after a permutation of the
  columns. This is a important classical problem, with close connections to statistical
  literature in permutation-based models and also has wide applications ranging from
  archaeology to biology. Specifically, we consider the case where the rows are monotonically
  increasing after an unknown permutation of the columns. Past work has shown that
  the least-squares estimator is optimal up to logarithmic factors, but efficient
  algorithms for computing the least-squares estimator remain unknown to date. We
  approach this important problem from a heuristic perspective. Specifically, we replace
  the combinatorial permutation constraint by a continuous regularization term, and
  then use projected gradient descent to obtain a local minimum of the non-convex
  objective. We show that the attained local minimum is the global minimum in certain
  special cases under the noiseless setting, and preserves desirable properties under
  the noisy setting. Simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm outperforms
  prior algorithms when (1) the underlying model is more complex than simplistic parametric
  assumptions such as low-rankedness, or (2) the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Under
  partial observations, the proposed algorithm requires an initialization, and different
  initializations may lead to different local minima. We empirically observe that
  the proposed algorithm yields consistent improvement over the initialization, even
  though different initializations start with different levels of quality.
