title: 'Contingency-aware influence maximization: A reinforcement learning approach'
abstract: The influence maximization (IM) problem aims at finding a subset of seed
  nodes in a social network that maximize the spread of influence. In this study,
  we focus on a sub-class of IM problems, where whether the nodes are willing to be
  the seeds when being invited is uncertain, called contingency-aware IM. Such contingency
  aware IM is critical for applications for non-profit organizations in low resource
  communities (e.g., spreading awareness of disease prevention). Despite the initial
  success, a major practical obstacle in promoting the solutions to more communities
  is the tremendous runtime of the greedy algorithms and the lack of high performance
  computing (HPC) for the non-profits in the field â€“ whenever there is a new social
  network, the non-profits usually do not have the HPCs to recalculate the solutions.
  Motivated by this and inspired by the line of works that use reinforcement learning
  (RL) to address combinatorial optimization on graphs, we formalize the problem as
  a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and use RL to learn an IM policy over historically
  seen networks, and generalize to unseen networks with negligible runtime at test
  phase. To fully exploit the properties of our targeted problem, we propose two technical
  innovations that improve the existing methods, including state-abstraction and theoretically
  grounded reward shaping. Empirical results show that our method achieves influence
  as high as the state-of-the-art methods for contingency-aware IM, while having negligible
  runtime at test phase.
