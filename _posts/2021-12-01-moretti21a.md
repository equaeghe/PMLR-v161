title: variational combinatorial sequential monte carlo methods for bayesian phylogenetic
  inference
abstract: Bayesian phylogenetic inference is often conducted via local or sequential
  search over topologies and branch lengths using algorithms such as random-walk Markov
  chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC). However,
  when MCMC is used for evolutionary parameter learning, convergence requires long
  runs with inefficient exploration of the state space. We introduce Variational Combinatorial
  Sequential Monte Carlo (VCSMC), a powerful framework that establishes variational
  sequential search to learn distributions over intricate combinatorial structures.
  We then develop nested CSMC, an efficient proposal distribution for CSMC and prove
  that nested CSMC is an exact approximation to the (intractable) locally optimal
  proposal. We use nested CSMC to define a second objective, VNCSMC which yields tighter
  lower bounds than VCSMC. We show that VCSMC and VNCSMC are computationally efficient
  and explore higher probability spaces than existing methods on a range of tasks.
