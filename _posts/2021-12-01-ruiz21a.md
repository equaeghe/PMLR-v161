title: Unbiased gradient estimation for variational auto-encoders using coupled Markov
  chains
abstract: The variational auto-encoder (VAE) is a deep latent variable model that
  has two neural networks in an autoencoder-like architecture; one of them parameterizes
  the modelâ€™s likelihood. Fitting its parameters via maximum likelihood (ML) is challenging
  since the computation of the marginal likelihood involves an intractable integral
  over the latent space; thus the VAE is trained instead by maximizing a variational
  lower bound. Here, we develop a ML training scheme for VAEs by introducing unbiased
  estimators of the log-likelihood gradient. We obtain the estimators by augmenting
  the latent space with a set of importance samples, similarly to the importance weighted
  auto-encoder (IWAE), and then constructing a Markov chain Monte Carlo coupling procedure
  on this augmented space. We provide the conditions under which the estimators can
  be computed in finite time and with finite variance. We show experimentally that
  VAEs fitted with unbiased estimators exhibit better predictive performance.
