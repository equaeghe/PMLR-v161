title: Subset-of-data variational inference for deep Gaussian-processes regression
abstract: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are multi-layer, flexible extensions of Gaussian
  Processes but their training remains challenging. Most existing methods for inference
  in DGPs use sparse approximation which require optimization over a large number
  of inducing inputs and their locations across layers. In this paper, we simplify
  the training by setting the locations to a fixed subset of data and sampling the
  inducing inputs from a variational distribution. This reduces the trainable parameters
  and computation cost without any performance degradation, as demonstrated by our
  empirical results on regression data sets. Our modifications simplify and stabilize
  DGP training methods while making them amenable to sampling schemes such as leverage
  score and determinantal point processes.
