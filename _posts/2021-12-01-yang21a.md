title: Multi-output Gaussian Processes for uncertainty-aware recommender systems
abstract: Recommender systems are often designed based on a collaborative filtering
  approach, where user preferences are predicted by modelling interactions between
  users and items. Many common approaches to solve the collaborative filtering task
  are based on learning representations of users and items, including simple matrix
  factorization, Gaussian process latent variable models, and neural-network based
  embeddings. While matrix factorization approaches fail to model nonlinear relations,
  neural networks can potentially capture such complex relations with unprecedented
  predictive power and are highly scalable. However, neither of them is able to model
  predictive uncertainties. In contrast, Gaussian Process based models can generate
  a predictive distribution, but cannot scale to large amounts of data. In this manuscript,
  we propose a novel approach combining the representation learning paradigm of collaborative
  filtering with multi-output Gaussian processes in a joint framework to generate
  uncertainty-aware recommendations. We introduce an efficient strategy for model
  training and inference, resulting in a model that scales to very large and sparse
  datasets and achieves competitive performance in terms of classical metrics quantifying
  the reconstruction error. In addition to accurately predicting user preferences,
  our model also provides meaningful uncertainty estimates about that prediction.
