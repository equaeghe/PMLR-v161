title: Trusted-maximizers entropy search for efficient Bayesian optimization
abstract: 'Information-based Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art
  performance in optimizing a black-box objective function. However, they usually
  require several approximations or simplifying assumptions (without clearly understanding
  their effects on the BO performance) and/or their generalization to batch BO is
  computationally unwieldy, especially with an increasing batch size. To alleviate
  these issues, this paper presents a novel trusted-maximizers entropy search (TES)
  acquisition function: It measures how much an input query contributes to the information
  gain on the maximizer over a finite set of trusted maximizers, i.e., inputs optimizing
  functions that are sampled from the Gaussian process posterior belief of the objective
  function. Evaluating TES requires either only a stochastic approximation with sampling
  or a deterministic approximation with expectation propagation, both of which are
  investigated and empirically evaluated using synthetic benchmark objective functions
  and real-world optimization problems, e.g., hyperparameter tuning of a convolutional
  neural network and synthesizing physically realizable faces to fool a black-box
  face recognition system. Though TES can naturally be generalized to a batch variant
  with either approximation, the latter is amenable to be scaled to a much larger
  batch size in our experiments.'
