title: Dependency in DAG models with hidden variables
abstract: Directed acyclic graph models with hidden variables have been much studied,
  particularly in view of their computational efficiency and connection with causal
  methods. In this paper we provide the circumstances under which it is possible for
  two variables to be identically equal, while all other observed variables stay jointly
  independent of them and mutually of each other. We find that this is possible if
  and only if the two variables are ‘densely connected’; in other words, if applications
  of identifiable causal interventions on the graph cannot (non-trivially) separate
  them. As a consequence of this, we can also allow such pairs of random variables
  have any bivariate joint distribution that we choose. This has implications for
  model search, since it suggests that we can reduce to only consider graphs in which
  densely connected vertices are always joined by an edge.
