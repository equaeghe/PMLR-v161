title: Approximation algorithm for submodular maximization under submodular cover
abstract: We study a new optimization problem called <em>submodular maximization under
  submodular cover</em> (SMSC), which requires to find a fixed-size set such that
  one monotone submodular function $f$ is maximized subject to that another monotone
  submodular function $g$ is maximized approximately. SMSC is preferable to submodular
  function maximization when one wants to maximize two objective functions simultaneously.
  We propose an optimization framework for SMSC, which guarantees a constant-factor
  approximation. Our algorithmâ€™s key idea is to construct a new instance of submodular
  function maximization from a given instance of SMSC, which can be approximated efficiently.
  Besides, if we are given an approximation oracle for submodular function maximization,
  our algorithm provably produces nearly optimal solutions. We experimentally evaluate
  the proposed algorithm in terms of sensor placement and movie recommendation using
  real-world data.
