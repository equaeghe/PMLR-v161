title: Certification of iterative predictions in Bayesian neural networks
abstract: We consider the problem of computing reach-avoid probabilities for iterative
  predictions made with Bayesian neural network (BNN) models. Specifically, we leverage
  bound propagation techniques and backward recursion to compute lower bounds for
  the probability that trajectories of the BNN model reach a given set of states while
  avoiding a set of unsafe states. We use the lower bounds in the context of control
  and reinforcement learning to provide safety certification for given control policies,
  as well as to synthesize control policies that improve the certification bounds.
  On a set of benchmarks, we demonstrate that our framework can be employed to certify
  policies over BNNs predictions for problems of more than $10$ dimensions, and to
  effectively synthesize policies that significantly increase the lower bound on the
  satisfaction probability.
