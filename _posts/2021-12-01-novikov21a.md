title: Tensor-train density estimation
abstract: Estimation of probability density function from samples is one of the central
  problems in statistics and machine learning. Modern neural network-based models
  can learn high dimensional distributions but have problems with hyperparameter selection
  and are often prone to instabilities during training and inference. We propose a
  new efficient tensor train-based model for density estimation (TTDE). Such density
  parametrization allows exact sampling, calculation of cumulative and marginal density
  functions, and partition function. It also has very intuitive hyperparameters. We
  develop an efficient non-adversarial training procedure for TTDE based on the Riemannian
  optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of the
  proposed method in density estimation and sampling tasks, while TTDE significantly
  outperforms competitors in training speed.
