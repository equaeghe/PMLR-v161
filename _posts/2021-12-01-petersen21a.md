title: 'GP-ConvCNP: Better generalization for conditional convolutional Neural Processes
  on time series data'
abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a family of conditional generative models that
  are able to model a distribution over functions, in a way that allows them to perform
  predictions at test time conditioned on a number of context points. A recent addition
  to this family, Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNP), have shown
  remarkable improvement in performance over prior art, but we find that they sometimes
  struggle to generalize when applied to time series data. In particular, they are
  not robust to distribution shifts and fail to extrapolate observed patterns into
  the future. By incorporating a Gaussian Process into the model, we are able to remedy
  this and at the same time improve performance within distribution. As an added benefit,
  the Gaussian Process reintroduces the possibility to sample from the model, a key
  feature of other members in the NP family.
