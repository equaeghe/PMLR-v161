title: Federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
abstract: Stochastic gradient MCMC methods, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
  (SGLD), employ fast but noisy gradient estimates to enable large-scale posterior
  sampling. Although we can easily extend SGLD to distributed settings, it suffers
  from two issues when applied to federated non-IID data. First, the variance of these
  estimates increases significantly. Second, delaying communication causes the Markov
  chains to diverge from the true posterior even for very simple models. To alleviate
  both these problems, we propose conducive gradients, a simple mechanism that combines
  local likelihood approximations to correct gradient updates. Notably, conducive
  gradients are easy to compute, and since we only calculate the approximations once,
  they incur negligible overhead. We apply conducive gradients to distributed stochastic
  gradient Langevin dynamics (DSGLD) and call the resulting method “federated stochastic
  gradient Langevin dynamics” (FSGLD). We demonstrate that our approach can handle
  delayed communication rounds, converging to the target posterior in cases where
  DSGLD fails. We also show that FSGLD outperforms DSGLD for non-IID federated data
  with experiments on metric learning and neural networks.
