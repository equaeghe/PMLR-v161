title: Geometric rates of convergence for kernel-based sampling algorithms
abstract: The rate of convergence of weighted kernel herding (WKH) and sequential
  Bayesian quadrature (SBQ), two kernel-based sampling algorithms for estimating integrals
  with respect to some target probability measure, is investigated. Under verifiable
  conditions on the chosen kernel and target measure, we establish a near-geometric
  rate of convergence for target measures that are nearly atomic. Furthermore, we
  show these algorithms perform comparably to the theoretical best possible sampling
  algorithm under the maximum mean discrepancy. An analysis is also conducted in a
  distributed setting. Our theoretical developments are supported by empirical observations
  on simulated data as well as a real world application.
