title: Combinatorial semi-bandit in the non-stationary environment
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary combinatorial semi-bandit
  problem, both in the switching case and in the dynamic case. In the general case
  where (a) the reward function is non-linear, (b) arms may be probabilistically triggered,
  and (c) only approximate offline oracle exists (Wang and Chen, NIPS 2017), our algorithm
  achieves $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{N T}/\Delta_{\min})$ distribution-dependent regret in
  the switching case, and $\tilde{O}({V}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ distribution-independent regret
  in the dynamic case, where ${N}$ is the number of switchings and ${V}$ is the sum
  of the total “distribution changes”, $m$ is the total number of arms, and $\Delta_{\min}$
  is a gap variable dependent on the distributions of arm outcomes. The regret bounds
  in both scenarios are nearly optimal, but our algorithm needs to know the parameter
  ${N}$ or ${V}$ in advance. We further show that by employing another technique,
  our algorithm no longer needs to know the parameters ${N}$ or ${V}$ but the regret
  bounds could become suboptimal. In a special case where the reward function is linear
  and we have an exact oracle, we apply a new technique to design a parameter-free
  algorithm that achieves nearly optimal regret both in the switching case and in
  the dynamic case without knowing the parameters in advance.
