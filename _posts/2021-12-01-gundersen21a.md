title: Active multi-fidelity Bayesian online changepoint detection
abstract: Online algorithms for detecting changepoints, or abrupt shifts in the behavior
  of a time series, are often deployed with limited resources, e.g., to edge computing
  settings such as mobile phones or industrial sensors. In these scenarios it may
  be beneficial to trade the cost of collecting an environmental measurement against
  the quality or “fidelity” of this measurement and how the measurement affects changepoint
  estimation. For instance, one might decide between inertial measurements or GPS
  to determine changepoints for motion. A Bayesian approach to changepoint detection
  is particularly appealing because we can represent our posterior uncertainty about
  changepoints and make active, cost-sensitive decisions about data fidelity to reduce
  this posterior uncertainty. Moreover, the total cost could be dramatically lowered
  through active fidelity switching, while remaining robust to changes in data distribution.
  We propose a multi-fidelity approach that makes cost-sensitive decisions about which
  data fidelity to collect based on maximizing information gain with respect to changepoints.
  We evaluate this framework on synthetic, video, and audio data and show that this
  information-based approach results in accurate predictions while reducing total
  cost.
