title: Identifying regions of trusted predictions
abstract: Quantifying the probability of a label prediction being correct on a given
  test point or a given sub-population enables users to better decide how to use and
  when to trust machine learning derived predictors. In this work, combining aspects
  of prior work on conformal predictions and selective classification, we provide
  a unifying framework for confidence requirements that allows for distinguishing
  between various sources of uncertainty in the learning process as well as various
  region specifications. We then consider a set of common prior assumptions on the
  data generating process and show how these allow learning justifiably trusted predictors.
