title: Subseasonal climate prediction in the western US using Bayesian spatial models
abstract: Subseasonal climate forecasting is the task of predicting climate variables,
  such as temperature and precipitation, in a two-week to two-month time horizon.
  The primary predictors for such prediction problem are spatio-temporal satellite
  and ground measurements of a variety of climate variables in the atmosphere, ocean,
  and land, which however have rather limited predictive signal at the subseasonal
  time horizon. We propose a carefully constructed spatial hierarchical Bayesian regression
  model that makes use of the inherent spatial structure of the subseasonal climate
  prediction task. We use our Bayesian model to then derive decision-theoretically
  optimal point estimates with respect to various performance measures of interest
  to climate science. As we show, our approach handily improves on various off-the-shelf
  ML baselines. Since our method is based on a Bayesian framework, we are also able
  to quantify the uncertainty in our predictions, which is particularly crucial for
  difficult tasks such as the subseasonal prediction, where we expect any model to
  have considerable uncertainty at different test locations under different scenarios.
