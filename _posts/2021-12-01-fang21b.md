title: Bayesian streaming sparse Tucker decomposition
abstract: Tucker decomposition is a classical tensor factorization model. Compared
  with the most widely used CP decomposition, the Tucker model is much more flexible
  and interpretable in that it accounts for every possible (multiplicative) interaction
  between the factors in different modes. However, this also brings in the risk of
  overfitting and computational challenges, especially in the case of fast streaming
  data. To address these issues, we develop BASS-Tucker, a BAyesian Streaming Sparse
  Tucker decomposition method. We place a spike-and-slab prior over the core tensor
  elements to automatically select meaningful factor interactions so as to prevent
  overfitting and to further enhance the interpretability. To enable efficient streaming
  factorization, we use conditional moment matching and Deltaâ€™s method to develop
  one-shot incremental update of the latent factors and core tensor upon receiving
  each streaming batch. Thereby, we avoid processing the data points one by one as
  in the standard assumed density filtering, which needs to update the core tensor
  for each point and is quite inefficient. We explicitly introduce and update a sparse
  prior approximation in the running posterior to fulfill effective sparse estimation
  in the streaming inference. We show the advantage of BASS-Tucker in several real-world
  applications.
