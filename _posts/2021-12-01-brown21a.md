title: Learning in Multi-Player Stochastic Games
abstract: 'We consider the problem of simultaneous learning in stochastic games with
  many players in the finite-horizon setting. While the typical target solution for
  a stochastic game is a Nash equilibrium, this is intractable with many players.
  We instead focus on variants of <em> correlated equilibria</em>, such as those studied
  for extensive-form games. We begin with a hardness result for the adversarial MDP
  problem: even for a horizon of 3, obtaining sublinear regret against the best non-stationary
  policy is NP-hard when both rewards and transitions are adversarial. This implies
  that convergence to even the weakest natural solution concept—normal-form coarse
  correlated equilibrium—is not possible via black-box reduction to a no-regret algorithm
  even in stochastic games with constant horizon (unless $NP\subseteqBPP$). Instead,
  we turn to a different target: algorithms which <em> generate</em> an equilibrium
  when they are used by all players. Our main result is algorithm which generates
  an <em> extensive-form</em> correlated equilibrium, whose runtime is exponential
  in the horizon but polynomial in all other parameters. We give a similar algorithm
  which is polynomial in all parameters for “fast-mixing” stochastic games. We also
  show a method for efficiently reaching normal-form coarse correlated equilibria
  in “single-controller” stochastic games which follows the traditional no-regret
  approach. When shared randomness is available, the two generative algorithms can
  be extended to give simultaneous regret bounds and converge in the traditional sense.'
