title: Causal and interventional Markov boundaries
abstract: 'Feature selection is an important problem in machine learning, which aims
  to select variables that lead to an optimal predictive model. In this paper, we
  focus on feature selection for post-intervention outcome prediction from pre-intervention
  variables. We are motivated by healthcare settings, where the goal is often to select
  the treatment that will maximize a specific patientâ€™s outcome; however, we often
  do not have sufficient randomized control trial data to identify well the conditional
  treatment effect. We show how we can use observational data to improve feature selection
  and effect estimation in two cases: (a) using observational data when we know the
  causal graph, and (b) when we do not know the causal graph but have observational
  and limited experimental data. Our paper extends the notion of Markov boundary to
  treatment-outcome pairs. We provide theoretical guarantees for the methods we introduce.
  In simulated data, we show that combining observational and experimental data improves
  feature selection and effect estimation.'
