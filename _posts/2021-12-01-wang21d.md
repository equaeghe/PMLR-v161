title: Explicit pairwise factorized graph neural network for semi-supervised node
  classification
abstract: Node features and structural information of a graph are both crucial for
  semi-supervised node classification problems. A variety of graph neural network
  (GNN) based approaches have been proposed to tackle these problems, which typically
  determine output labels through feature aggregation. This can be problematic, as
  it implies conditional independence of output nodes given hidden representations,
  despite their direct connections in the graph. To learn the direct influence among
  output nodes in a graph, we propose the Explicit Pairwise Factorized Graph Neural
  Network (EPFGNN), which models the whole graph as a partially observed Markov Random
  Field. It contains explicit pairwise factors to model output-output relations and
  uses a GNN backbone to model input-output relations. To balance model complexity
  and expressivity, the pairwise factors have a shared component and a separate scaling
  coefficient for each edge. We apply the EM algorithm to train our model, and utilize
  a star-shaped piecewise likelihood for the tractable surrogate objective. We conduct
  experiments on various datasets, which shows that our model can effectively improve
  the performance for semi-supervised node classification on graphs.
