title: Learning proposals for probabilistic programs with inference combinators
abstract: We develop operators for construction of proposals in probabilistic programs,
  which we refer to as inference combinators. Inference combinators define a grammar
  over importance samplers that compose primitive operations such as application of
  a transition kernel and importance resampling. Proposals in these samplers can be
  parameterized using neural networks, which in turn can be trained by optimizing
  variational objectives. The result is a framework for user-programmable variational
  methods that are correct by construction and can be tailored to specific models.
  We demonstrate the flexibility of this framework by implementing advanced variational
  methods based on amortized Gibbs sampling and annealing.
