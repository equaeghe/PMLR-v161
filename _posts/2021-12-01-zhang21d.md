title: Dynamic visualization for L1 fusion convex clustering in near-linear time
abstract: Convex clustering has drawn recent attention because of its competitive
  performance and nice property to guarantee global optimality. However, convex clustering
  is infeasible due to its high computational cost for large-scale data sets. We propose
  a novel method to solve the L1 fusion convex clustering problem by dynamic programming.
  We develop the Convex clustering Path Algorithm In Near-linear Time (C-PAINT) algorithm
  to construct the solution path efficiently. The proposed C-PAINT yields the exact
  solution while other general solvers for convex problems applied in the convex clustering
  depend on tuning parameters such as step size and threshold, and it usually takes
  many iterations to converge. Including a sorting process that almost takes no time
  in practice, the main part of the algorithm takes only linear time. Thus, C-PAINT
  has superior scalability comparing to other state-of-art algorithms. Moreover, C-PAINT
  enables the path visualization of clustering solutions for large data. In particular,
  experiments show our proposed method can solve the convex clustering with 10^7 data
  points in two minutes. We demonstrate the proposed method using both synthetic data
  and real data. Our algorithms are implemented in the dpcc R package.
