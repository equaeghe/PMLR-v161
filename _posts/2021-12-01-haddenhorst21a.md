title: Testification of Condorcet Winners in dueling bandits
abstract: 'Several algorithms for finding the best arm in the dueling bandits setting
  assume the existence of a Condorcet winner (CW), that is, an arm that uniformly
  dominates all other arms. Yet, by simply relying on this assumption but not verifying
  it, such algorithms may produce doubtful results in cases where it actually fails
  to hold. Even worse, the problem may not be noticed, and an alleged CW still be
  produced. In this paper, we therefore address the problem as a ”testification” task,
  by which we mean a combination of testing and identification: The online identification
  of the CW is combined with the statistical testing of the CW assumption. Thus, instead
  of returning a supposed CW at some point, the learner has the possibility to stop
  sampling and refuse an answer in case it feels confident that the CW assumption
  is violated. Analyzing the testification problem formally, we derive lower bounds
  on the expected sample complexity of any online algorithm solving it. Moreover,
  a concrete algorithm is proposed, which achieves the optimal sample complexity up
  to logarithmic terms.'
