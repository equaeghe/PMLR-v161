title: Sketching curvature for efficient out-of-distribution detection for deep neural
  networks
abstract: In order to safely deploy Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) within the perception
  pipelines of real-time decision making systems, there is a need for safeguards that
  can detect out-of-training-distribution (OoD) inputs both efficiently and accurately.
  Building on recent work leveraging the local curvature of DNNs to reason about epistemic
  uncertainty, we propose Sketching Curvature for OoD Detection (SCOD), an architecture-agnostic
  framework for equipping any trained DNN with a task-relevant epistemic uncertainty
  estimate. Offline, given a trained model and its training data, SCOD employs tools
  from matrix sketching to tractably compute a low-rank approximation of the Fisher
  information matrix which characterizes which directions in the weight space are
  most influential on the predictions over the training data. Online, we estimate
  uncertainty by measuring how much perturbations orthogonal to these directions can
  alter predictions at a new test input. We apply SCOD to pre-trained networks of
  varying architectures on several tasks, ranging from regression to classification.
  We demonstrate that SCOD achieves comparable of better OoD detection performance
  with lower computational burden relative to existing baselines.
