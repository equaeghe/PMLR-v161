title: Class balancing GAN with a classifier in the loop
abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have swiftly evolved to imitate increasingly
  complex image distributions. However, majority of the developments focus on performance
  of GANs on balanced datasets. We find that the existing GANs and their training
  regimes which work well on balanced datasets fail to be effective in case of imbalanced
  (i.e. long-tailed) datasets. In this work we introduce a novel theoretically motivated
  Class Balancing regularizer for training GANs. Our regularizer makes use of the
  knowledge from a pre-trained classifier to ensure balanced learning of all the classes
  in the dataset. This is achieved via modelling the effective class frequency based
  on the exponential forgetting observed in neural networks and encouraging the GAN
  to focus on underrepresented classes. We demonstrate the utility of our regularizer
  in learning representations for long-tailed distributions via achieving better performance
  than existing approaches over multiple datasets. Specifically, when applied to an
  unconditional GAN, it improves the FID from $13.03$ to $9.01$ on the long-tailed
  iNaturalist-$2019$ dataset.
