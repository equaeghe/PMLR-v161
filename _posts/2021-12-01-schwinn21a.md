title: Identifying untrustworthy predictions in neural networks by geometric gradient
  analysis
abstract: The susceptibility of deep neural networks to untrustworthy predictions,
  including out-of-distribution (OOD) data and adversarial examples, still prevent
  their widespread use in safety-critical applications. Most existing methods either
  require a retraining of a given model to achieve robust identification of adversarial
  attacks or are limited to out-of-distribution sample detection only. In this work,
  we propose a geometric gradient analysis (GGA) to improve the identification of
  untrustworthy predictions without retraining of a given model. GGA analyzes the
  geometry of the loss landscape of neural networks based on the saliency maps of
  their respective input. We observe considerable differences between the input gradient
  geometry of trustworthy and untrustworthy predictions. Using these differences,
  GGA outperforms prior approaches in detecting OOD data and adversarial attacks,
  including state-of-the-art and adaptive attacks.
