title: Partial Identifiability in Discrete Data with Measurement Error
abstract: When data contains measurement errors, it is necessary to make modeling
  assumptions relating the error-prone measurements to the unobserved true values.
  Work on measurement error has largely focused on models that fully identify the
  parameter of interest. As a result, many practically useful models that result in
  <em>bounds</em> on the target parameter – known as partial identification – have
  been neglected. In this work, we present a method for partial identification in
  a class of measurement error models involving discrete variables. We focus on models
  that impose linear constraints on the target parameter, allowing us to compute partial
  identification bounds using off-the-shelf LP solvers. We show how several common
  measurement error assumptions can be composed with an extended class of instrumental
  variable-type models to create such linear constraint sets. We further show how
  this approach can be used to bound causal parameters, such as the average treatment
  effect, when treatment or outcome variables are measured with error. Using data
  from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, we apply this method to estimate bounds
  on the effect Medicaid enrollment has on depression when depression is measured
  with error.
